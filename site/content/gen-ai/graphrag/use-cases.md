## GraphRAG Enterprise Use Cases

Whether you are evaluating GraphRAG for your organization or looking to understand 
its business applications, these real-world scenarios demonstrate how GraphRAG can transform the way you extract insights from your data.

### Enterprise knowledge management

**Scenario**: A consulting firm has accumulated thousands of PDF reports, research papers, 
and client documents over years. Team members struggle to find relevant information 
quickly and often miss connections between different projects.

**GraphRAG solution**: The pipeline processes all documents, creating a knowledge graph 
that understands how concepts relate across different projects and time periods. Team 
members can now ask questions like "What approaches have we used for supply chain 
optimization across different industries?" and get comprehensive answers that reference 
multiple documents and projects.

**Business value**:
- Reduces research time by 70%
- Improves proposal quality by leveraging past insights  
- Enables knowledge sharing across teams

### Research and development

**Scenario**: A pharmaceutical company's R&D team needs to analyze research papers, 
clinical trial data, and regulatory documents to identify potential drug interactions 
and development pathways.

**GraphRAG solution**: The system processes all research documents, clinical data, and 
regulatory information, creating connections between different studies and findings. 
Researchers can query complex relationships like "What are the common side effects 
mentioned across all Phase II trials for similar compounds?"

**Business value**:
- Accelerates research insights
- Reduces risk of missing critical connections
- Improves decision-making speed

### Legal document analysis

**Scenario**: A law firm needs to analyze case law, legal precedents, and client 
documents to build comprehensive legal strategies.

**GraphRAG solution**: The pipeline processes legal documents, creating a knowledge 
graph that understands legal precedents, case relationships, and argument patterns. 
Lawyers can ask complex questions like "How have similar contract disputes been 
resolved in different jurisdictions?"

**Business value**:
- Improves case preparation quality
- Reduces research time  
- Enables more comprehensive legal strategies

## GraphRAG versus Traditional RAG (VectorRAG)

Traditional RAG systems find text chunks that are semantically similar to your query. 
However, they don't understand the inherent relationships between these chunks.

For example, when asked, "What is the fix for Issue A?", a VectorRAG system might 
retrieve two separate, unstructured chunks: one describing "Issue A" and another 
mentioning a "Fix 1" for a related system. Because the connection isn't explicit, 
the LLM cannot confidently link them and will often default to a safe, unhelpful answer:

**VectorRAG Response**: _"The context does not provide a specific fix for Issue A."_

GraphRAG overcomes this limitation by retrieving a subgraph of interconnected data. 
Instead of just text, it provides the LLM with a clear map of how information is related.

For the same question, GraphRAG fetches structured triplets (node-relationship-node), 
such as `(Issue A) -> [HAS_FIX] -> (Fix 1)`. This context is unambiguous, it explicitly 
states the relationship between the problem and the solution, allowing the LLM to 
provide a direct and correct answer:

**GraphRAG Response**: _"The fix for Issue A is Fix 1."_

The key difference is that VectorRAG gives the LLM a pile of ingredients, while GraphRAG 
provides the actual recipe.
