## References to other documents

The character data you imported has an attribute `traits` for each character,
which is an array of strings. It does not store character features directly,
however:

```json
{
  "_key": "ned",
  "name": "Ned",
  "surname": "Stark",
  "alive": false,
  "age": 41,
  "traits": ["A","H","C","N","P"]
}
```

It is rather a list of letters without an apparent meaning. The idea here is
that `traits` is supposed to store documents keys of another collection, which
you can use to resolve the letters to labels such as "strong". The benefit of
using another collection for the actual traits is, that you can easily query
for all existing traits later on and store labels in multiple languages for
instance in a central place. If you would embed traits directly...

```json
{
  "_key": "ned",
  "name": "Ned",
  "surname": "Stark",
  "alive": false,
  "age": 41,
  "traits": [
    {
      "de": "stark",
      "en": "strong"
    },
    {
      "de": "einflussreich",
      "en": "powerful"
    },
    {
      "de": "loyal",
      "en": "loyal"
    },
    {
      "de": "rational",
      "en": "rational"
    },
    {
      "de": "mutig",
      "en": "brave"
    }
  ]
}
```

... it becomes difficult to maintain traits. If you were to rename or
translate one of them, you would need to find all other character documents
with the same trait and perform the changes there too. If you only refer to a
trait in another collection, it is as easy as updating a single document.

## Importing traits

1. In the web interface, create a document collection called `Traits`.
2. Enter the following AQL query:
   ```aql
   FOR trait IN @data
     INSERT trait INTO Traits
   ```
3. Set the following for the `data` bind variable:
   ```json
   [
     { "_key": "A", "en": "strong", "de": "stark" },
     { "_key": "B", "en": "polite", "de": "freundlich" },
     { "_key": "C", "en": "loyal", "de": "loyal" },
     { "_key": "D", "en": "beautiful", "de": "schön" },
     { "_key": "E", "en": "sneaky", "de": "hinterlistig" },
     { "_key": "F", "en": "experienced", "de": "erfahren" },
     { "_key": "G", "en": "corrupt", "de": "korrupt" },
     { "_key": "H", "en": "powerful", "de": "einflussreich" },
     { "_key": "I", "en": "naive", "de": "naiv" },
     { "_key": "J", "en": "unmarried", "de": "unverheiratet" },
     { "_key": "K", "en": "skillful", "de": "geschickt" },
     { "_key": "L", "en": "young", "de": "jung" },
     { "_key": "M", "en": "smart", "de": "klug" },
     { "_key": "N", "en": "rational", "de": "rational" },
     { "_key": "O", "en": "ruthless", "de": "skrupellos" },
     { "_key": "P", "en": "brave", "de": "mutig" },
     { "_key": "Q", "en": "mighty", "de": "mächtig" },
     { "_key": "R", "en": "weak", "de": "schwach" }
   ]
   ```
4. Execute the query to import the trait data.

## Resolving traits

Start simple by returning only the traits attribute of each character:

```aql
FOR c IN Characters
  RETURN c.traits
```

```json
[
  ["A","H","C","N","P"],
  ["D","H","C"],
  ...
]
```

Also see the [Fundamentals of Objects / Documents](../../aql/fundamentals/data-types.md#objects--documents)
about attribute access.

You can use the `traits` array together with the `DOCUMENT()` function to use
the elements as document keys and look them up in the `Traits` collection:

```aql
FOR c IN Characters
  RETURN DOCUMENT("Traits", c.traits)
```

```json
[
  [
    {
      "_key": "A",
      "_id": "Traits/A",
      "_rev": "_V5oRUS2---",
      "en": "strong",
      "de": "stark"
    },
    {
      "_key": "H",
      "_id": "Traits/H",
      "_rev": "_V5oRUS6--E",
      "en": "powerful",
      "de": "einflussreich"
    },
    {
      "_key": "C",
      "_id": "Traits/C",
      "_rev": "_V5oRUS6--_",
      "en": "loyal",
      "de": "loyal"
    },
    {
      "_key": "N",
      "_id": "Traits/N",
      "_rev": "_V5oRUT---D",
      "en": "rational",
      "de": "rational"
    },
    {
      "_key": "P",
      "_id": "Traits/P",
      "_rev": "_V5oRUTC---",
      "en": "brave",
      "de": "mutig"
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      "_key": "D",
      "_id": "Traits/D",
      "_rev": "_V5oRUS6--A",
      "en": "beautiful",
      "de": "schön"
    },
    {
      "_key": "H",
      "_id": "Traits/H",
      "_rev": "_V5oRUS6--E",
      "en": "powerful",
      "de": "einflussreich"
    },
    {
      "_key": "C",
      "_id": "Traits/C",
      "_rev": "_V5oRUS6--_",
      "en": "loyal",
      "de": "loyal"
    }
  ],
  ...
]
```

The [`DOCUMENT()` function](../../aql/functions/miscellaneous.md#document) can be used
to look up a single or multiple documents via document identifiers. In our
example, you pass the collection name from which you want to fetch documents
as first argument (`"Traits"`) and an array of document keys (`_key` attribute)
as second argument. In return, you get an array of the full trait documents
for each character.

This is a bit too much information, so only return English labels using
the [array expansion](../../aql/operators.md#array-expansion) notation:

```aql
FOR c IN Characters
  RETURN DOCUMENT("Traits", c.traits)[*].en
```

```json
[
  [
    "strong",
    "powerful",
    "loyal",
    "rational",
    "brave"
  ],
  [
    "beautiful",
    "powerful",
    "loyal"
  ],
  ...
]
```

## Merging characters and traits

Great, you resolved the letters to meaningful traits! But you also need to know
to which character they belong. Thus, you need to merge both the character
document and the data from the trait documents:

```aql
FOR c IN Characters
  RETURN MERGE(c, { traits: DOCUMENT("Traits", c.traits)[*].en } )
```

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "Characters/ned",
    "_key": "ned",
    "_rev": "_V1bzsXa---",
    "age": 41,
    "alive": false,
    "name": "Ned",
    "surname": "Stark",
    "traits": [
      "strong",
      "powerful",
      "loyal",
      "rational",
      "brave"
    ]
  },
  {
    "_id": "Characters/catelyn",
    "_key": "catelyn",
    "_rev": "_V1bzsXa--B",
    "age": 40,
    "alive": false,
    "name": "Catelyn",
    "surname": "Stark",
    "traits": [
      "beautiful",
      "powerful",
      "loyal"
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

The `MERGE()` functions merges objects together. Because you used an object
`{ traits: ... }` which has the same attribute name `traits` as the original
character attribute, the latter got overwritten by the merge operation.

## Join another way

The `DOCUMENT()` function utilizes primary indexes to look up documents quickly.
It is limited to find documents via their identifiers however. For a use case
like in our example it is sufficient to accomplish a simple join.

There is another, more flexible syntax for joins: nested `FOR` loops over
multiple collections, with a `FILTER` condition to match up attributes.
In case of the traits key array, there needs to be a third loop to iterate
over the keys:

```aql
FOR c IN Characters
  RETURN MERGE(c, {
    traits: (
      FOR key IN c.traits
        FOR t IN Traits
          FILTER t._key == key
          RETURN t.en
    )
  })
```

For each character, it loops over its `traits` attribute (e.g. `["D","H","C"]`)
and for each document reference in this array, it loops over the `Traits`
collections. There is a condition to match the document key with the key
reference. The inner `FOR` loop and the `FILTER` get transformed to a primary
index lookup in this case instead of building up a Cartesian product only to
filter away everything but a single match: Document keys within a collection
are unique, thus there can only be one match.

Each written-out, English trait is returned and all the traits are then merged
with the character document. The result is identical to the query using
`DOCUMENT()`. However, this approach with a nested `FOR` loop and a `FILTER`
is not limited to primary keys. You can do this with any other attribute as well.
For an efficient lookup, make sure you add a persistent index for this attribute.
If its values are unique, then also set the index option to unique.

Another advantage of the `FOR` loop approach is the performance compared to
calling the `DOCUMENT()` function: The query optimizer can optimize AQL queries
better that iterate over a collection and possibly filter by attributes and only
make use of a subset of the found documents. With the `DOCUMENT()` function,
there are individual lookups, potentially across all collections, and the full
documents need to be loaded regardless of which attributes are actually used.
