Based on the data you have uploaded, you can start designing your graph.
The graph designer allows you to create a schema using nodes and edges.
Once this is done, you can start the import which creates the corresponding
collections in your database instance.

## How to add a node

1. To create a new node, click the **Add node** button.
2. In the graph designer, click on the newly create node to view the **Node details**.
3. In the **Node details** panel, fill in the following fields:
   - For **Node label**, enter a label or a name you want to use.
   - For **File**, select a file from the list to associate it with the node.
   - For **Primary Identifier**, select a property from the list.
   - For **File Headers**, select one or more property from the list.
