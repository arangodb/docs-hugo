_arangorestore_ is a command-line client tool to restore backups created by
[_arangodump_](../arangodump/) to
[ArangoDB servers](../arangodb-server/).

If you want to import data in formats like JSON or CSV, see
[_arangoimport_](../arangoimport/) instead.

_arangorestore_ can restore selected collections or all collections of a backup,
optionally including _system_ collections. One can restore the structure, i.e.
the collections with their configuration with or without data.
Views can also be dumped or restored (either all of them or selectively).

  In order to speed up the _arangorestore_ performance in a Cluster environment,
the [Fast Cluster Restore](programs-arangorestore-fast-cluster-restore)
procedure is recommended.
