Use [_arangodump_](../arangodump/) and
[_arangorestore_](../arangorestore/) for
[logical backups](../../backup-restore/#logical-backups) in the Community Edition.

{{< tag "ArangoDB Enterprise" >}}

_Arangobackup_ is a command-line client tool for instantaneous and
consistent [hot backups](../../backup-restore/#hot-backups) of the data and
structures stored in ArangoDB.

Hot backups rely on hard link magic performed on the database's
persistence layer.

_Arangobackup_ can be used for all ArangoDB deployment modes
(Single Instance, Active Failover, Cluster). It always creates what
is most readily described as a persistence layer consistent snapshot
of the entire instance. Therefore, no such thing as database or
collection level hot backup exists. Consequently, unlike with
_arangodump_/_arangorestore_, one may only restore a hot backup set to
the same layout, for example one can only restore a single server hot backup 
to a single server instance and a 3 _DB-Server_ cluster's hot backup to a 3
_DB-Server_ instance.

Snapshots can be uploaded to or downloaded from remote repositories.
