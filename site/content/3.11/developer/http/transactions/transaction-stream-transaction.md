For an introduction to this transaction type, see
[Stream Transactions](../../transactions/transactions-stream-transactions).

To use a Stream Transaction, a client first sends the [configuration](#begin-a-transaction)
of the transaction to the ArangoDB server.


{{% hints/info %}}
  Contrary to [**JavaScript Transactions**](transaction-js-transaction),
the definition of Stream Transaction must only contain the collections that are
going to be used and (optionally) the various transaction options supported by
ArangoDB. No `action` attribute is supported.
{{% /hints/info %}}

The Stream Transaction API works in *conjunction* with other APIs in ArangoDB.
To use the transaction for a supported operation a client needs to specify
the transaction identifier in the `x-arango-trx-id` HTTP header on each request.
This will automatically cause these operations to use the specified transaction.

Supported transactional API operations include:

1. All operations in the [Document API](../documents/document-working-with-documents)
2. Number of documents via the [Collection API](../collections/collection-getting#return-number-of-documents-in-a-collection)
3. Truncate a collection via the [Collection API](../collections/collection-creating#truncate-collection)
4. Create an AQL cursor via the [Cursor API](../aql-query-cursors/aql-query-cursor-accessing-cursors)
5. Handle [vertices](../graphs/gharial-vertices) and [edges](../graphs/gharial-edges)
   of managed graphs (_General Graph_ / _Gharial_ API)

## Begin a Transaction

<!-- RestTransactionHandler.cpp -->
##  Begin transaction
```http-spec
openapi: 3.0.2
paths:
  /_api/transaction/begin:
    post:
      description: |2+
        The transaction description must be passed in the body of the POST request.
        If the transaction can be started on the server, *HTTP 201* will be returned.
        For successfully started transactions, the returned JSON object has the
        following properties:
        - *error*: boolean flag to indicate if an error occurred (*false*
          in this case)
        - *code*: the HTTP status code
        - *result*: result containing
            - *id*: the identifier of the transaction
            - *status*: containing the string 'running'
        If the transaction specification is either missing or malformed, the server
        will respond with *HTTP 400* or *HTTP 404*.
        The body of the response will then contain a JSON object with additional error
        details. The object has the following attributes:
        - *error*: boolean flag to indicate that an error occurred (*true* in this case)
        - *code*: the HTTP status code
        - *errorNum*: the server error number
        - *errorMessage*: a descriptive error message

        description: |+
          Set this header to `true` to allow the Coordinator to ask any shard replica for
          the data, not only the shard leader. This may result in "dirty reads".
          This header decides about dirty reads for the entire transaction. Individual
          read operations, that are performed as part of the transaction, cannot override it.

                    *read*, *write* or *exclusive*, each being an array of collection names or a
                    single collection name as string. Collections that will be written to in the
                    transaction must be declared with the *write* or *exclusive* attribute or it
                    will fail, whereas non-declared collections from which is solely read will be
                    added lazily.
                waitForSync:
                  type: boolean

                    an optional boolean flag that, if set, will force the
                    transaction to write all data to disk before returning.

                    an optional numeric value that can be used to set a
                    timeout in seconds for waiting on collection locks. This option is only
                    meaningful when using exclusive locks. If not specified, a default
                    value will be used. Setting *lockTimeout* to *0* will make ArangoDB
                    not time out waiting for a lock.

## Commit or Abort a Transaction

Committing or aborting a running transaction must be done by the client.
It is *bad practice* to not commit or abort a transaction once you are done
using it. It will force the server to keep resources and collection locks 
until the entire transaction times out.

<!-- RestTransactionHandler.cpp -->
##  Commit transaction
```http-spec
openapi: 3.0.2
paths:
  /_api/transaction/{transaction-id}:
    put:
      description: |2+
        Commit a running server-side transaction. Committing is an idempotent operation.
        It is not an error to commit a transaction more than once.
        If the transaction can be committed, *HTTP 200* will be returned.
        The returned JSON object has the following properties:
        - *error*: boolean flag to indicate if an error occurred (*false*
          in this case)
        - *code*: the HTTP status code
        - *result*: result containing
            - *id*: the identifier of the transaction
            - *status*: containing the string 'committed'
        If the transaction cannot be found, committing is not allowed or the
        transaction was aborted, the server
        will respond with *HTTP 400*, *HTTP 404* or *HTTP 409*.
        The body of the response will then contain a JSON object with additional error
        details. The object has the following attributes:
        - *error*: boolean flag to indicate that an error occurred (*true* in this case)
        - *code*: the HTTP status code
