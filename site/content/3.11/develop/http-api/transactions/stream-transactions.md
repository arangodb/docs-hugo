  Stream Transactions allow you to perform a multi-document transaction with
  individual begin and commit/abort commands
archetype: default
---
For an introduction to this transaction type, see
[Stream Transactions](../../transactions/stream-transactions.md).

To use a Stream Transaction, a client first sends the [configuration](#begin-a-stream-transaction)
of the transaction to the ArangoDB server.

{{< info >}}
Contrary to [**JavaScript Transactions**](javascript-transactions.md),
the definition of Stream Transaction must only contain the collections that are
going to be used and (optionally) the various transaction options supported by
ArangoDB. No `action` attribute is supported.
{{< /info >}}

The Stream Transaction API works in *conjunction* with other APIs in ArangoDB.
To use the transaction for a supported operation a client needs to specify
the transaction identifier in the `x-arango-trx-id` HTTP header on each request.
This will automatically cause these operations to use the specified transaction.

Supported transactional API operations include:

- All operations in the [Document API](../documents.md)
- Number of documents via the [Collection API](../collections.md#get-the-document-count-of-a-collection)
- Truncate a collection via the [Collection API](../collections.md#truncate-a-collection)
- Create an AQL cursor via the [Cursor API](../queries/aql-queries.md#create-a-cursor)
- Handle [vertices](../graphs/named-graphs.md#vertices) and [edges](../graphs/named-graphs.md#edges)
  of managed graphs (_General Graph_ / _Gharial_ API)

## Begin a Stream Transaction

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/transaction/begin:
    post:
      operationId: beginStreamTransaction
      description: |
        Begin a Stream Transaction that allows clients to call selected APIs over a
        short period of time, referencing the transaction ID, and have the server
        execute the operations transactionally.

        Committing or aborting a running transaction must be done by the client.
        It is bad practice to not commit or abort a transaction once you are done
        using it. It forces the server to keep resources and collection locks
        until the entire transaction times out.

        The transaction description must be passed in the body of the POST request.
        If the transaction can be started on the server, *HTTP 201* will be returned.

        For successfully started transactions, the returned JSON object has the
        following properties:

        - `error`: boolean flag to indicate if an error occurred (`false`
          in this case)

        - `code`: the HTTP status code

        - `result`: result containing
            - `id`: the identifier of the transaction
            - `status`: containing the string 'running'

        If the transaction specification is either missing or malformed, the server
        will respond with *HTTP 400* or *HTTP 404*.

        The body of the response will then contain a JSON object with additional error
        details. The object has the following attributes:

        - `error`: boolean flag to indicate that an error occurred (`true` in this case)

        - `code`: the HTTP status code

        - `errorNum`: the server error number

        - `errorMessage`: a descriptive error message
      parameters:
        - name: x-arango-allow-dirty-read
          in: header
          required: false
          description: |
            Set this header to `true` to allow the Coordinator to ask any shard replica for
            the data, not only the shard leader. This may result in "dirty reads".

            This header decides about dirty reads for the entire transaction. Individual
            read operations, that are performed as part of the transaction, cannot override it.

                    `collections` must be a JSON object that can have one or all sub-attributes
                    `read`, `write` or `exclusive`, each being an array of collection names or a
                    single collection name as string. Collections that will be written to in the
                    transaction must be declared with the `write` or `exclusive` attribute or it
                    will fail, whereas non-declared collections from which is solely read will be
                    added lazily.

                    timeout in seconds for waiting on collection locks. This option is only
                    meaningful when using exclusive locks. If not specified, a default
                    value will be used. Setting `lockTimeout` to `0` will make ArangoDB
                    not time out waiting for a lock.

        It is not an error to commit a transaction more than once.

        If the transaction can be committed, *HTTP 200* will be returned.
        The returned JSON object has the following properties:
