  You can deploy Foxx services with Foxx CLI, the ArangoDB HTTP API, or its
  web interface
archetype: default
---
Foxx services can be deployed in multiple ways:

- [Foxx CLI](../../components/tools/foxx-cli/_index.md), a command line tool which
  requires Node.js

- [HTTP API](../http-api/foxx.md) using HTTP requests,
  e.g. with curl

- [web interface](../../components/web-interface/services.md) under *SERVICES*

See [the Foxx cluster guide](guides/foxx-in-a-cluster.md#how-arangodb-distributes-services)
for how Foxx services are distributed to Coordinators.
