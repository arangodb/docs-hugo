  ArangoDB drivers allow you to connect ArangoDB to your applications and manage
  the database system via a language-specific interface
archetype: chapter
---
Database drivers, also called connectors, adapters, or client libraries, let you
access and manage database systems. ArangoDB drivers are interfaces between
programming languages and ArangoDB, which enable software developers to connect
to and manipulate ArangoDB deployments from within compiled programs or using
scripting languages.

From a language perspective, documents and database structures can be integrated
with data types and their methods. The precise mapping of concepts and methods
depends on the capabilities and practices of each language.

Programming is a powerful way of automating interactions and control of the
database, as well as to integrate database operations into your own software.
The drivers listed below are officially maintained and supported by ArangoDB.
If your programming language or environment is not listed,
