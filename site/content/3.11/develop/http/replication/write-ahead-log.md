The WAL Access API is used to facilitate faster and
more reliable asynchronous replication. The API offers access to the 
write-ahead log or operations log of the ArangoDB server. As a public
API, it is only supported to access these REST endpoints on a single-server
instance. While these APIs are also available on DB-Server instances, accessing them
as a user is not supported. This API replaces some of the APIs in `/_api/replication`.

## Get the tick ranges available in the WAL

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/wal/range:
    get:
      operationId: getWalRange
      description: |
        Returns the currently available ranges of tick values for all Write-Ahead Log
        (WAL) files. The tick values can be used to determine if certain
        data (identified by tick value) are still available for replication.

        The body of the response contains a JSON object.
        - `tickMin`: minimum tick available
        - `tickMax`: maximum tick available
        - `time`: the server time as string in format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
        - `server`: An object with fields `version` and `serverId`
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |
            is returned if the tick ranges could be determined successfully.
        '405':
          description: |
            is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.
        '500':
          description: |
            is returned if the server operations state could not be determined.
        '501':
          description: |
            is returned when this operation is called on a Coordinator in a cluster.
      tags:
        - Replication
```

**Examples**

```curl
---
description: |-
  Returns the available tick ranges.
name: RestWalAccessTickRange
---
var url = "/_api/wal/range";

var response = logCurlRequest('GET', url);

assert(response.code === 200);

logJsonResponse(response);
```

## Get the last available tick value

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/wal/lastTick:
    get:
      operationId: getWalLastTick
      description: |
        Returns the last available tick value that can be served from the server's
        replication log. This corresponds to the tick of the latest successful operation.

        The result is a JSON object containing the attributes `tick`, `time` and `server`.
        - `tick`: contains the last available tick, `time`
        - `time`: the server time as string in format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`
        - `server`: An object with fields `version` and `serverId`

        **Note**: this method is not supported on a Coordinator in a cluster.
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |
            is returned if the request was executed successfully.
        '405':
          description: |
            is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.
        '500':
          description: |
            is returned if an error occurred while assembling the response.
        '501':
          description: |
            is returned when this operation is called on a Coordinator in a cluster.
      tags:
        - Replication
```

**Examples**

```curl
---
description: |-
  Returning the first available tick
name: RestWalAccessFirstTick
---
var url = "/_api/wal/lastTick";
var response = logCurlRequest('GET', url);

assert(response.code === 200);

logJsonResponse(response);
```

## Tail recent server operations

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/wal/tail:
    get:
      operationId: getWalTail
      description: |
        Returns data from the server's write-ahead log (also named replication log). This method can be called
        by replication clients after an initial synchronization of data. The method
        returns all "recent" logged operations from the server. Clients
        can replay and apply these operations locally so they get to the same data
        state as the server.

        Clients can call this method repeatedly to incrementally fetch all changes
        from the server. In this case, they should provide the `from` value so
        they only get returned the log events since their last fetch.

        When the `from` query parameter is not used, the server returns log
        entries starting at the beginning of its replication log. When the `from`
        parameter is used, the server only returns log entries which have
        higher tick values than the specified `from` value (note: the log entry with a
        tick value equal to `from` is excluded). Use the `from` value when
        incrementally fetching log data.

        The `to` query parameter can be used to optionally restrict the upper bound of
        the result to a certain tick value. If used, the result contains only log events
        with tick values up to (including) `to`. In incremental fetching, there is no
        need to use the `to` parameter. It only makes sense in special situations,
        when only parts of the change log are required.

        The `chunkSize` query parameter can be used to control the size of the result.
        It must be specified in bytes. The `chunkSize` value is only honored
        approximately. Otherwise, a too low `chunkSize` value could cause the server
        to not be able to put just one log entry into the result and return it.
        Therefore, the `chunkSize` value is only consulted after a log entry has
        been written into the result. If the result size is then greater than
        `chunkSize`, the server responds with as many log entries as there are
        in the response already. If the result size is still less than `chunkSize`,
        the server tries to return more data if there's more data left to return.

        If `chunkSize` is not specified, some server-side default value is used.

        The `Content-Type` of the result is `application/x-arango-dump`. This is an
        easy-to-process format, with all log events going onto separate lines in the
        response body. Each log event itself is a JSON object, with at least the
        following attributes:

        - `tick`: the log event tick value

        - `type`: the log event type

        Individual log events also have additional attributes, depending on the
        event type. A few common attributes which are used for multiple events types
        are:

        - `cuid`: globally unique id of the View or collection the event was for

        - `db`: the database name the event was for

        - `tid`: id of the transaction the event was contained in

        - `data`: the original document data

        A more detailed description of the individual replication event types and their
        data structures can be found in [Operation Types](#operation-types).

        The response also contains the following HTTP headers:

        - `x-arango-replication-active`: whether or not the logger is active. Clients
          can use this flag as an indication for their polling frequency. If the
          logger is not active and there are no more replication events available, it
          might be sensible for a client to abort, or to go to sleep for a long time
          and try again later to check whether the logger has been activated.

        - `x-arango-replication-lastincluded`: the tick value of the last included
          value in the result. In incremental log fetching, this value can be used
          as the `from` value for the following request. **Note** that if the result is
          empty, the value is `0`. This value should not be used as `from` value
          by clients in the next request (otherwise the server would return the log
          events from the start of the log again).

        - `x-arango-replication-lastscanned`: the last tick the server scanned while
          computing the operation log. This might include operations the server did not
          returned to you due to various reasons (i.e. the value was filtered or skipped).
          You may use this value in the `lastScanned` header to allow the RocksDB storage engine
          to break up requests over multiple responses.

        - `x-arango-replication-lasttick`: the last tick value the server has
          logged in its write ahead log (not necessarily included in the result). By comparing the last
          tick and last included tick values, clients have an approximate indication of
          how many events there are still left to fetch.

        - `x-arango-replication-frompresent`: is set to _true_ if server returned
          all tick values starting from the specified tick in the _from_ parameter.
          Should this be set to false the server did not have these operations anymore
          and the client might have missed operations.

        - `x-arango-replication-checkmore`: whether or not there already exists more
          log data which the client could fetch immediately. If there is more log data
          available, the client could call the tailing API again with an adjusted `from`
          value to fetch remaining log entries until there are no more.

          If there isn't any more log data to fetch, the client might decide to go
          to sleep for a while before calling the logger again.

        **Note**: this method is not supported on a Coordinator in a cluster.

## Operation Types

There are several different operation types thar an ArangoDB server might print. 
All operations include a `tick` value which identified their place in the operations log.
The numeric fields _tick_ and _tid_ always contain stringified numbers to avoid problems with 
drivers where numbers in JSON might be mishandled.

The following operation types are used in ArangoDB:

### Create Database (1100)

Insert or replace a document. Contains the field _db_ with the database name,
_cuid_ with the globally unique id to identify the collection and the field _tid_ for 
the transaction id. The field *tid* might contain the value *"0"* to identify a single
