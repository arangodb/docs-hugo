## Cursors

Results of AQL queries are returned as cursors in order to batch the communication
between server and client. Each batch contains a number of documents and an
indication if the current batch is the final batch. Depending on the query, the
total number of documents in the result set may or may not be known in advance.

If the number of documents doesn't exceed the batch size, the full query result
is returned to the client in a single round-trip. If there are more documents,
then the first batch is returned to the client and the client needs to use the
cursor to retrieve the other batches.

In order to free up server resources, the client should delete a cursor as soon
as it is no longer needed.

### Single roundtrip

The server only transfers a certain number of result documents back to the
client in one roundtrip. This number is controllable by the client by setting
the `batchSize` attribute when issuing the query.

If the complete result can be transferred to the client in one go, the client
does not need to issue any further request. The client can check whether it has
retrieved the complete result set by checking the `hasMore` attribute of the
result set. If it is set to `false`, then the client has fetched the complete
result set from the server. In this case, no server-side cursor is created.

```js
> curl --data @- -X POST --dump - http://localhost:8529/_api/cursor
{ "query" : "FOR u IN users LIMIT 2 RETURN u", "count" : true, "batchSize" : 2 }

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-type: application/json

{
  "hasMore" : false,
  "error" : false,
  "result" : [
    {
      "name" : "user1",
      "_rev" : "210304551",
      "_key" : "210304551",
      "_id" : "users/210304551"
    },
    {
      "name" : "user2",
      "_rev" : "210304552",
      "_key" : "210304552",
      "_id" : "users/210304552"
    }
  ],
  "code" : 201,
  "count" : 2
}
```

### Using a cursor

If the result set contains more documents than should be transferred in a single
roundtrip (i.e. as set via the `batchSize` attribute), the server returns
the first few documents and creates a temporary cursor. The cursor identifier
is also returned to the client. The server puts the cursor identifier
in the `id` attribute of the response object. Furthermore, the `hasMore`
attribute of the response object is set to `true`. This is an indication
for the client that there are additional results to fetch from the server.

**Examples**

Create and extract first batch:

```js
> curl --data @- -X POST --dump - http://localhost:8529/_api/cursor
{ "query" : "FOR u IN users LIMIT 5 RETURN u", "count" : true, "batchSize" : 2 }

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-type: application/json

{
  "hasMore" : true,
  "error" : false,
  "id" : "26011191",
  "result" : [
    {
      "name" : "user1",
      "_rev" : "258801191",
      "_key" : "258801191",
      "_id" : "users/258801191"
    },
    {
      "name" : "user2",
      "_rev" : "258801192",
      "_key" : "258801192",
      "_id" : "users/258801192"
    }
  ],
  "code" : 201,
  "count" : 5
}
```

Extract next batch, still have more:

```js
> curl -X POST --dump - http://localhost:8529/_api/cursor/26011191

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "hasMore" : true,
  "error" : false,
  "id" : "26011191",
  "result": [
    {
      "name" : "user3",
      "_rev" : "258801193",
      "_key" : "258801193",
      "_id" : "users/258801193"
    },
    {
      "name" : "user4",
      "_rev" : "258801194",
      "_key" : "258801194",
      "_id" : "users/258801194"
    }
  ],
  "code" : 200,
  "count" : 5
}
```

Extract next batch, done:

```js
> curl -X POST --dump - http://localhost:8529/_api/cursor/26011191

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "hasMore" : false,
  "error" : false,
  "result" : [
    {
      "name" : "user5",
      "_rev" : "258801195",
      "_key" : "258801195",
      "_id" : "users/258801195"
    }
  ],
  "code" : 200,
  "count" : 5
}
```

Do not do this because `hasMore` now has a value of false:

```js
> curl -X POST --dump - http://localhost:8529/_api/cursor/26011191

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-type: application/json

{
  "errorNum": 1600,
  "errorMessage": "cursor not found: disposed or unknown cursor",
  "error": true,
  "code": 404
}
```

If the `allowRetry` query option is set to `true`, then the response object
contains a `nextBatchId` attribute, except for the last batch (if `hasMore` is
`false`). If retrieving a result batch fails because of a connection issue, you
can ask for that batch again using the `POST /_api/cursor/<cursor-id>/<batch-id>`
endpoint. The first batch has an ID of `1` and the value is incremented by 1
with every batch. Every result response except the last one also includes a
`nextBatchId` attribute, indicating the ID of the batch after the current.
You can remember and use this batch ID should retrieving the next batch fail.

```js
> curl --data @- -X POST --dump - http://localhost:8529/_api/cursor
{ "query": "FOR i IN 1..5 RETURN i", "batchSize": 2, "options": { "allowRetry": true } }

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-type: application/json

{
  "result":[1,2],
  "hasMore":true,
  "id":"3517",
  "nextBatchId":2,
  "cached":false,
  "error":false,
  "code":201
}
```

Fetching the second batch would look like this:

```js
> curl -X POST --dump - http://localhost:8529/_api/cursor/3517
```

Assuming the above request fails because of a connection issue but advances the
cursor nonetheless, you can retry fetching the batch using the `nextBatchId` of
the first request (`2`):

```js
curl -X POST --dump http://localhost:8529/_api/cursor/3517/2

{
  "result":[3,4],
  "hasMore":true,
  "id":"3517",
  "nextBatchId":3,
  "cached":false,
  "error":false,
  "code":200
}
```

To allow refetching of the last batch of the query, the server cannot
automatically delete the cursor. After the first attempt of fetching the last
batch, the server would normally delete the cursor to free up resources. As you
might need to reattempt the fetch, it needs to keep the final batch when the
`allowRetry` option is enabled. Once you successfully received the last batch,
you should call the `DELETE /_api/cursor/<cursor-id>` endpoint so that the
server doesn't unnecessarily keep the batch until the cursor times out
(`ttl` query option).

```js
curl -X POST --dump http://localhost:8529/_api/cursor/3517/3

{
  "result":[5],
  "hasMore":false,
  "id":"3517",
  "cached":false,
  "error":false,
  "code":200
}

curl -X DELETE --dump http://localhost:8529/_api/cursor/3517

{
  "id":"3517",
  "error":false,
  "code":202
}
```

If you are no longer interested in the results of a query, you can call the
`DELETE /_api/cursor/<cursor-id>` endpoint as long as a cursor exists to discard
the cursor, even before you requested the last batch.

## Execute AQL queries

### Create a cursor

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/cursor:
    post:
      operationId: createAqlQueryCursor
      description: |
        Submits an AQL query for execution in the current database. The server returns
        a result batch and may indicate that further batches need to be fetched using
        a cursor identifier.

        The query details include the query string plus optional query options and
        bind parameters. These values need to be passed in a JSON representation in
        the body of the POST request.
      parameters:
        - name: x-arango-allow-dirty-read
          in: header
          required: false
          description: |
            Set this header to `true` to allow the Coordinator to ask any shard replica for
            the data, not only the shard leader. This may result in "dirty reads".

            The header is ignored if this operation is part of a Stream Transaction
            (`x-arango-trx-id` header). The header set when creating the transaction decides
            about dirty reads for the entire transaction, not the individual read operations.
          schema:
            type: boolean
        - name: x-arango-trx-id
          in: header
          required: false
          description: |
            To make this operation a part of a Stream Transaction, set this header to the
            transaction ID returned by the `POST /_api/transaction/begin` call.
          schema:
            type: string
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              required:
                - query
              properties:
                query:
                  description: |
                    contains the query string to be executed
                  type: string
                count:
                  description: |
                    indicates whether the number of documents in the result set should be returned in
                    the "count" attribute of the result.
                    Calculating the "count" attribute might have a performance impact for some queries
                    in the future so this option is turned off by default, and "count"
                    is only returned when requested.
                  type: boolean
                batchSize:
                  description: |
                    maximum number of result documents to be transferred from
                    the server to the client in one roundtrip. If this attribute is
                    not set, a server-controlled default value will be used. A `batchSize` value of
                    `0` is disallowed.
                  type: integer
                ttl:
                  description: |
                    The time-to-live for the cursor (in seconds). If the result set is small enough
                    (less than or equal to `batchSize`) then results are returned right away.
                    Otherwise they are stored in memory and will be accessible via the cursor with
                    respect to the `ttl`. The cursor will be removed on the server automatically
                    after the specified amount of time. This is useful to ensure garbage collection
                    of cursors that are not fully fetched by clients. If not set, a server-defined
                    value will be used (default: 30 seconds).
                  type: integer
                cache:
                  description: |
                    flag to determine whether the AQL query results cache
                    shall be used. If set to `false`, then any query cache lookup will be skipped
                    for the query. If set to `true`, it will lead to the query cache being checked
                    for the query if the query cache mode is either `on` or `demand`.
                  type: boolean
                memoryLimit:
                  description: |
                    the maximum number of memory (measured in bytes) that the query is allowed to
                    use. If set, then the query will fail with error "resource limit exceeded" in
                    case it allocates too much memory. A value of `0` indicates that there is no
                    memory limit.
                  type: integer
                bindVars:
                  description: |
                    An object with key/value pairs representing the bind parameters.
                    For a bind variable `@var` in the query, specify the value using an attribute
                    with the name `var`. For a collection bind variable `@@coll`, use `@coll` as the
                    attribute name. For example: `"bindVars": { "var": 42, "@coll": "products" }`.
                  type: object
                options:
                  description: |
                    key/value object with extra options for the query.
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    fullCount:
                      description: |
                        if set to `true` and the query contains a `LIMIT` clause, then the
                        result will have an `extra` attribute with the sub-attributes `stats`
                        and `fullCount`, `{ ... , "extra": { "stats": { "fullCount": 123 } } }`.
                        The `fullCount` attribute will contain the number of documents in the result before the
                        last top-level LIMIT in the query was applied. It can be used to count the number of
                        documents that match certain filter criteria, but only return a subset of them, in one go.
                        It is thus similar to MySQL's *SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS* hint. Note that setting the option
                        will disable a few LIMIT optimizations and may lead to more documents being processed,
                        and thus make queries run longer. Note that the `fullCount` attribute may only
                        be present in the result if the query has a top-level LIMIT clause and the LIMIT
                        clause is actually used in the query.
                      type: boolean
                    fillBlockCache:
                      description: |
                        if set to `true` or not specified, this will make the query store the data it
                        reads via the RocksDB storage engine in the RocksDB block cache. This is usually
                        the desired behavior. The option can be set to `false` for queries that are
                        known to either read a lot of data which would thrash the block cache, or for queries
                        that read data which are known to be outside of the hot set. By setting the option
                        to `false`, data read by the query will not make it into the RocksDB block cache if
                        not already in there, thus leaving more room for the actual hot set.
                      type: boolean
                    maxNumberOfPlans:
                      description: |
                        Limits the maximum number of plans that are created by the AQL query optimizer.
                      type: integer
                    maxNodesPerCallstack:
                      description: |
                        The number of execution nodes in the query plan after that stack splitting is
                        performed to avoid a potential stack overflow. Defaults to the configured value
                        of the startup option `--query.max-nodes-per-callstack`.

                        This option is only useful for testing and debugging and normally does not need
                        any adjustment.
                      type: integer
                    maxWarningCount:
                      description: |
                        Limits the maximum number of warnings a query will return. The number of warnings
                        a query will return is limited to 10 by default, but that number can be increased
                        or decreased by setting this attribute.
                      type: integer
                    failOnWarning:
                      description: |
                        When set to `true`, the query will throw an exception and abort instead of producing
                        a warning. This option should be used during development to catch potential issues
                        early. When the attribute is set to `false`, warnings will not be propagated to
                        exceptions and will be returned with the query result.
                        There is also a server configuration option `--query.fail-on-warning` for setting the
                        default value for `failOnWarning` so it does not need to be set on a per-query level.
                      type: boolean
                    allowRetry:
                      description: |
                        Set this option to `true` to make it possible to retry
                        fetching the latest batch from a cursor. The default is `false`.

                        If retrieving a result batch fails because of a connection issue, you can ask
                        for that batch again using the `POST /_api/cursor/<cursor-id>/<batch-id>`
                        endpoint. The first batch has an ID of `1` and the value is incremented by 1
                        with every batch. Every result response except the last one also includes a
                        `nextBatchId` attribute, indicating the ID of the batch after the current.
                        You can remember and use this batch ID should retrieving the next batch fail.

                        You can only request the latest batch again (or the next batch).
                        Earlier batches are not kept on the server-side.
                        Requesting a batch again does not advance the cursor.

                        You can also call this endpoint with the next batch identifier, i.e. the value
                        returned in the `nextBatchId` attribute of a previous request. This advances the
                        cursor and returns the results of the next batch. This is only supported if there
                        are more results in the cursor (i.e. `hasMore` is `true` in the latest batch).

                        From v3.11.1 onward, you may use the `POST /_api/cursor/<cursor-id>/<batch-id>`
                        endpoint even if the `allowRetry` attribute is `false` to fetch the next batch,
                        but you cannot request a batch again unless you set it to `true`.

                        To allow refetching of the very last batch of the query, the server cannot
                        automatically delete the cursor. After the first attempt of fetching the last
                        batch, the server would normally delete the cursor to free up resources. As you
                        might need to reattempt the fetch, it needs to keep the final batch when the
                        `allowRetry` option is enabled. Once you successfully received the last batch,
                        you should call the `DELETE /_api/cursor/<cursor-id>` endpoint so that the
                        server doesn't unnecessarily keep the batch until the cursor times out
                        (`ttl` query option).

                        executed as long as necessary to produce up to `batchSize` results. These
                        results are returned immediately and the query is suspended until the client
                        asks for the next batch (if there are more results). Depending on the query
                        this can mean that the first results will be available much faster and that
                        less memory is needed because the server only needs to store a subset of
                        results at a time. Read-only queries can benefit the most, unless `SORT`
                        without index or `COLLECT` are involved that make it necessary to process all
                        documents before a partial result can be returned. It is advisable to only use
                        this option for queries without exclusive locks.

                        Remarks:
                        - The query will hold resources until it ends (such as RocksDB snapshots, which
                          prevents compaction to some degree). Writes will be in memory until the query
                          is committed.
                        - If existing documents are modified, then write locks are held on these
                          documents and other queries trying to modify the same documents will fail
                          because of this conflict.
                        - A streaming query may fail late because of a conflict or for other reasons
                          after some batches were already returned successfully, possibly rendering the
                          results up to that point meaningless.
                        - The query options `cache`, `count` and `fullCount` are not supported for
                          streaming queries.
                        - Query statistics, profiling data and warnings are delivered as part of the
                          last batch.

                        If the `stream` option is `false` (default), then the complete result of the
                        query is calculated before any of it is returned to the client. The server
                        stores the full result in memory (on the contacted Coordinator if in a cluster).
                        All other resources are freed immediately (locks, RocksDB snapshots). The query
                        will fail before it returns results in case of a conflict.

                        This is used for decreasing the memory usage during the query execution.

                        This option only has an effect on queries that use the `SORT` operation but
                        without a `LIMIT`, and if you enable the spillover feature by setting a path
                        for the directory to store the temporary data in with the

                        and single servers for non-streaming queries. To avoid the buildup of
                        the entire query result in RAM, use a streaming query (see the `stream` option).

                        (i.e. `FOR i IN 1..100`), each row is one of such temporary values.

                        representation of an AQL `FILTER` condition.

                        Yon can use this option to limit the computation time and memory usage when
                        converting complex AQL `FILTER` conditions into the internal DNF
                        (disjunctive normal form) format. `FILTER` conditions with a lot of logical
                        branches (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) can take a large amount of processing time and
                        memory. This query option limits the computation time and memory usage for
                        such conditions.

                        Once the threshold value is reached during the DNF conversion of a `FILTER`
                        condition, the conversion is aborted, and the query continues with a simplified
                        internal representation of the condition, which **cannot be used for index lookups**.

                        You can set the threshold globally instead of per query with the
                        `--query.max-dnf-condition-members` startup option.

                        with certain use-cases: A graph contains several collections and different users
                        execute AQL queries on that graph. You can naturally limit the accessible
                        results by changing the access rights of users on collections.

                              from a collection, and the `filtered` value only indicates how much filtering was done by a

  To set a memory limit for the query, the `memoryLimit` option can be passed to
  the server.

  The memory limit specifies the maximum number of bytes that the query is
  allowed to use. When a single AQL query reaches the specified limit value,
  the query is aborted with a *resource limit exceeded* exception. In a
  cluster, the memory accounting is done per server, so the limit value is
  effectively a memory limit per query per server.

  If no memory limit is specified, then the server default value (controlled by
  startup option `--query.memory-limit`) is used for restricting the maximum amount
  of memory the query can use. A memory limit value of `0` means that the maximum
  amount of memory for the query is not restricted.

                              Repurposing an existing cursor object is normally more efficient compared to destroying an
                              existing cursor object and creating a new one from scratch.

                              from a collection, and the `filtered` value only indicates how much filtering was done by a

### Read the next batch from a cursor (deprecated)

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/cursor/{cursor-identifier}:
    put:
      operationId: getNextAqlQueryCursorBatchPut
      description: |
        {{</* warning */>}}
        This endpoint is deprecated in favor its functionally equivalent POST counterpart.
        {{</* /warning */>}}

        If the cursor is still alive, returns an object with the following
        attributes:

        - `id`: a `cursor-identifier`
        - `result`: a list of documents for the current batch
        - `hasMore`: `false` if this was the last batch
        - `count`: if present the total number of elements
        - `code`: an HTTP status code
        - `error`: a boolean flag to indicate whether an error occurred
        - `errorNum`: a server error number (if `error` is `true`)
        - `errorMessage`: a descriptive error message (if `error` is `true`)
        - `extra`: an object with additional information about the query result, with
          the nested objects `stats` and `warnings`. Only delivered as part of the last
          batch in case of a cursor with the `stream` option enabled.

        Note that even if `hasMore` returns `true`, the next call might
        still return no documents. If, however, `hasMore` is `false`, then
        the cursor is exhausted.  Once the `hasMore` attribute has a value of
        `false`, the client can stop.

### Read a batch from the cursor again

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/cursor/{cursor-identifier}/{batch-identifier}:
    post:
      operationId: getPreviousAqlQueryCursorBatch
      description: |
        You can use this endpoint to retry fetching the latest batch from a cursor.
        The endpoint requires the `allowRetry` query option to be enabled for the cursor.

        Calling this endpoint with the last returned batch identifier returns the
        query results for that same batch again. This does not advance the cursor.
        Client applications can use this to re-transfer a batch once more in case of
        transfer errors.

        You can also call this endpoint with the next batch identifier, i.e. the value
        returned in the `nextBatchId` attribute of a previous request. This advances the
        cursor and returns the results of the next batch.

        From v3.11.1 onward, you may use this endpoint even if the `allowRetry`
        attribute is `false` to fetch the next batch, but you cannot request a batch
        again unless you set it to `true`.

        Note that it is only supported to query the last returned batch identifier or
        the directly following batch identifier. The latter is only supported if there
        are more results in the cursor (i.e. `hasMore` is `true` in the latest batch).

        Note that when the last batch has been consumed successfully by a client
        application, it should explicitly delete the cursor to inform the server that it
        successfully received and processed the batch so that the server can free up
        resources.
      parameters:
        - name: cursor-identifier

          in: path
          required: true

            The ID of the batch. The first batch has an ID of `1` and the value is
            incremented by 1 with every batch. You can only request the latest batch again
            (or the next batch). Earlier batches are not kept on the server-side.

                      Note that even if `hasMore` returns `true`, the next call might still return no
                      documents. Once `hasMore` is `false`, the cursor is exhausted and the client
                      can stop asking for more results.

                      The ID of the batch after the current one. The first batch has an ID of `1` and
                      the value is incremented by 1 with every batch. You can remember and use this
                      batch ID should retrieving the next batch fail. Use the
                      `POST /_api/cursor/<cursor-id>/<batch-id>` endpoint to ask for the batch again.

                              from a collection, and the `filtered` value only indicates how much filtering was done by a
                              post filter in the `IndexNode` itself or following `FilterNode` nodes.
                              Nodes of the `EnumerateCollectionNode` and `TraversalNode` types can also apply
                              filter conditions and can report the number of filtered documents.

### Delete a cursor

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/cursor/{cursor-identifier}:
    delete:
      operationId: deleteAqlQueryCursor
      description: |
        Deletes the cursor and frees the resources associated with it.

        The cursor will automatically be destroyed on the server when the client has
        retrieved all documents from it. The client can also explicitly destroy the
        cursor at any earlier time using an HTTP DELETE request. The cursor id must
        be included as part of the URL.

        Note: the server will also destroy abandoned cursors automatically after a
        certain server-controlled timeout to avoid resource leakage.

## Track queries

You can track AQL queries by enabling query tracking. This allows you to list
all currently executing queries. You can also list slow queries and clear this
list.

### Get the AQL query tracking configuration

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/query/properties:
    get:
      operationId: getAqlQueryTrackingProperties
      description: |
        Returns the current query tracking configuration. The configuration is a
        JSON object with the following properties:

        - `enabled`: if set to `true`, then queries will be tracked. If set to
          `false`, neither queries nor slow queries will be tracked.

        - `trackSlowQueries`: if set to `true`, then slow queries will be tracked
          in the list of slow queries if their runtime exceeds the value set in
          `slowQueryThreshold`. In order for slow queries to be tracked, the `enabled`
          property must also be set to `true`.

        - `trackBindVars`: if set to `true`, then bind variables used in queries will
          be tracked.

        - `maxSlowQueries`: the maximum number of slow queries to keep in the list
          of slow queries. If the list of slow queries is full, the oldest entry in
          it will be discarded when additional slow queries occur.

        - `slowQueryThreshold`: the threshold value for treating a query as slow. A
          query with a runtime greater or equal to this threshold value will be
          put into the list of slow queries when slow query tracking is enabled.
          The value for `slowQueryThreshold` is specified in seconds.

        - `maxQueryStringLength`: the maximum query string length to keep in the
          list of queries. Query strings can have arbitrary lengths, and this property
          can be used to save memory in case very long query strings are used. The
          value is specified in bytes.
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |
            Is returned if properties were retrieved successfully.
        '400':

        - `query`: the query string (potentially truncated)

        - `bindVars`: the bind parameter values used by the query

        - `started`: the date and time when the query was started

        - `runTime`: the query's run time up to the point the list of queries was
          queried

        - `peakMemoryUsage`: the query's peak memory usage in bytes (in increments of 32KB)

        - `state`: the query's current execution state (as a string). One of:

## Kill queries

Running AQL queries can be killed on the server. To kill a running query, its ID
(as returned for the query in the list of currently running queries) must be
specified. The kill flag of the query is then set, and the query is aborted as
soon as it reaches a cancelation point.

## Explain and parse AQL queries

You can retrieve the execution plan for any valid AQL query, as well as
syntactically validate AQL queries. Both functionalities don't actually execute
the supplied AQL query, but only inspect it and return meta information about it.

You can also retrieve a list of all query optimizer rules and their properties.

### Explain an AQL query

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/explain:
    post:
      operationId: explainAqlQuery
      description: |
        To explain how an AQL query would be executed on the server, the query string
        can be sent to the server via an HTTP POST request. The server will then validate
        the query and create an execution plan for it. The execution plan will be
        returned, but the query will not be executed.

        The execution plan that is returned by the server can be used to estimate the
        probable performance of the query. Though the actual performance will depend
        on many different factors, the execution plan normally can provide some rough
        estimates on the amount of work the server needs to do in order to actually run
        the query.

        By default, the explain operation will return the optimal plan as chosen by
        the query optimizer The optimal plan is the plan with the lowest total estimated
        cost. The plan will be returned in the attribute `plan` of the response object.
        If the option `allPlans` is specified in the request, the result will contain
        all plans created by the optimizer. The plans will then be returned in the
        attribute `plans`.

        The result will also contain an attribute `warnings`, which is an array of
        warnings that occurred during optimization or execution plan creation. Additionally,
        a `stats` attribute is contained in the result with some optimizer statistics.
        If `allPlans` is set to `false`, the result will contain an attribute `cacheable`
        that states whether the query results can be cached on the server if the query
        result cache were used. The `cacheable` attribute is not present when `allPlans`
        is set to `true`.

        Each plan in the result is a JSON object with the following attributes:
        - `nodes`: the array of execution nodes of the plan.

        - `estimatedCost`: the total estimated cost for the plan. If there are multiple
          plans, the optimizer will choose the plan with the lowest total cost.

        - `collections`: an array of collections used in the query

        - `rules`: an array of rules the optimizer applied.

        - `variables`: array of variables used in the query (note: this may contain
          internal variables created by the optimizer)

  The data returned in the **plan** attribute of the result contains one element per AQL top-level statement
  (i.e. `FOR`, `RETURN`, `FILTER` etc.). If the query optimizer removed some unnecessary statements,
  the result might also contain less elements than there were top-level statements in the AQL query.

  The following example shows a query with a non-sensible filter condition that
  the optimizer has removed so that there are less top-level statements.
