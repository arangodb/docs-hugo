  The HTTP API for named graphs lets you manage General Graphs, SmartGraphs,
  EnterpriseGraphs, and SatelliteGraphs
archetype: default
---
The HTTP API for [named graphs](../../../graphs/first-steps.md#named-graphs) is called _Gharial_.

You can manage all types of ArangoDB's named graphs with Gharial:
- [General Graphs](../../../graphs/general-graphs/_index.md)
- [SmartGraphs](../../../graphs/smartgraphs/_index.md)
- [EnterpriseGraphs](../../../graphs/enterprisegraphs/_index.md)
- [SatelliteGraphs](../../../graphs/satellitegraphs/_index.md)

The examples use the following example graphs:

[_Social Graph_](../../../graphs/example-graphs.md#social-graph):

![Social Example Graph](../../../../images/social_graph.png)

[_Knows Graph_](../../../graphs/example-graphs.md#knows-graph):

![Social Example Graph](../../../../images/knows_graph.png)

                          up-to-date copies succeed at the same time, however. The value of

                          up-to-date copies succeed at the same time, however. The value of

                          in sync on the different DB-Servers. If there are less than these many copies
                          in the cluster, a shard refuses to write. Writes to shards with enough
                          up-to-date copies succeed at the same time, however. The value of

                          For SatelliteGraphs, the `writeConcern` is automatically controlled to equal the

### Add an edge definition

  /_api/gharial/{graph}/edge:
    post:
      operationId: createEdgeDefinition
      description: |
        Adds an additional edge definition to the graph.

        This edge definition has to contain a `collection` and an array of
        each `from` and `to` vertex collections.  An edge definition can only
        be added if this definition is either not used in any other graph, or
        it is used with exactly the same definition. It is not possible to
        store a definition "e" from "v1" to "v2" in the one graph, and "e"
        from "v2" to "v1" in the other graph.

        Additionally, collection creation options can be set.

                          in sync on the different DB-Servers. If there are less than these many copies
                          in the cluster, a shard refuses to write. Writes to shards with enough
                          up-to-date copies succeed at the same time, however. The value of
                          `writeConcern` cannot be greater than `replicationFactor`.
                          For SatelliteGraphs, the `writeConcern` is automatically controlled to equal the
