## Management

### List the installed services

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/foxx:
    get:
      operationId: listFoxxServices
      description: |
        Fetches a list of services installed in the current database.

        Returns a list of objects with the following attributes:

        - `mount`: the mount path of the service
        - `development`: `true` if the service is running in development mode
        - `legacy`: `true` if the service is running in 2.8 legacy compatibility mode
        - `provides`: the service manifest's `provides` value or an empty object

        Additionally the object may contain the following attributes if they have been set on the manifest:

### Install a new service

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/foxx:
    post:
      operationId: createFoxxService
      description: |
        Installs the given new service at the given mount path.

        The request body can be any of the following formats:

        - `application/zip`: a raw zip bundle containing a service
        - `application/javascript`: a standalone JavaScript file
        - `application/json`: a service definition as JSON
        - `multipart/form-data`: a service definition as a multipart form

        A service definition is an object or form with the following properties or fields:

        - `configuration`: a JSON object describing configuration values
        - `dependencies`: a JSON object describing dependency settings
        - `source`: a fully qualified URL or an absolute path on the server's file system

        When using multipart data, the `source` field can also alternatively be a file field
        containing either a zip bundle or a standalone JavaScript file.

        When using a standalone JavaScript file the given file will be executed
        to define our service's HTTP endpoints. It is the same which would be defined
        in the field `main` of the service manifest.

        If `source` is a URL, the URL must be reachable from the server.
        If `source` is a file system path, the path will be resolved on the server.
        In either case the path or URL is expected to resolve to a zip bundle,
        JavaScript file or (in case of a file system path) directory.

        Note that when using file system paths in a cluster with multiple Coordinators
        the file system path must resolve to equivalent files on every Coordinator.
      parameters:
        - name: mount
          in: query
          required: true
          description: |
            Mount path the service should be installed at.
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: development
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Set to `true` to enable development mode.
          schema:
            type: boolean
        - name: setup
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Set to `false` to not run the service's setup script.
          schema:
            type: boolean
        - name: legacy
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Set to `true` to install the service in 2.8 legacy compatibility mode.
          schema:
            type: boolean
      responses:

          description: |
            Returned if the request was successful.
      tags:
        - Foxx
```

### Uninstall a service

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/foxx/service:
    delete:
      operationId: deleteFoxxService
      description: |
        Removes the service at the given mount path from the database and file system.

        Returns an empty response on success.
      parameters:
        - name: mount
          in: query
          required: true
          description: |
            Mount path of the installed service.
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: teardown
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Set to `false` to not run the service's teardown script.
          schema:
            type: boolean
      responses:
        '204':
          description: |
            Returned if the request was successful.
      tags:
        - Foxx
```

### Replace a service

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/foxx/service:
    put:
      operationId: replaceFoxxService
      description: |
        Removes the service at the given mount path from the database and file system.
        Then installs the given new service at the same mount path.

        This is a slightly safer equivalent to performing an uninstall of the old service
        followed by installing the new service. The new service's main and script files
        (if any) will be checked for basic syntax errors before the old service is removed.

        The request body can be any of the following formats:

        - `application/zip`: a raw zip bundle containing a service
        - `application/javascript`: a standalone JavaScript file
        - `application/json`: a service definition as JSON
        - `multipart/form-data`: a service definition as a multipart form

        A service definition is an object or form with the following properties or fields:

        - `configuration`: a JSON object describing configuration values
        - `dependencies`: a JSON object describing dependency settings
        - `source`: a fully qualified URL or an absolute path on the server's file system

        When using multipart data, the `source` field can also alternatively be a file field
        containing either a zip bundle or a standalone JavaScript file.

        When using a standalone JavaScript file the given file will be executed
        to define our service's HTTP endpoints. It is the same which would be defined
        in the field `main` of the service manifest.

        If `source` is a URL, the URL must be reachable from the server.
        If `source` is a file system path, the path will be resolved on the server.
        In either case the path or URL is expected to resolve to a zip bundle,
        JavaScript file or (in case of a file system path) directory.

        Note that when using file system paths in a cluster with multiple Coordinators
        the file system path must resolve to equivalent files on every Coordinator.
      parameters:
        - name: mount
          in: query
          required: true
          description: |
            Mount path of the installed service.
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: teardown
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Set to `false` to not run the old service's teardown script.
          schema:

        - name: setup
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Set to `false` to not run the new service's setup script.

            type: boolean
        - name: legacy
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Set to `true` to install the new service in 2.8 legacy compatibility mode.
          schema:
            type: boolean
        - name: force
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Set to `true` to force service install even if no service is installed under given mount.
          schema:
            type: boolean
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |

### Upgrade a service

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/foxx/service:
    patch:
      operationId: upgradeFoxxService
      description: |
        Installs the given new service on top of the service currently installed at the given mount path.
        This is only recommended for switching between different versions of the same service.

        Unlike replacing a service, upgrading a service retains the old service's configuration
        and dependencies (if any) and should therefore only be used to migrate an existing service
        to a newer or equivalent service.

        The request body can be any of the following formats:

        - `application/zip`: a raw zip bundle containing a service
        - `application/javascript`: a standalone JavaScript file
        - `application/json`: a service definition as JSON
        - `multipart/form-data`: a service definition as a multipart form

        A service definition is an object or form with the following properties or fields:

        - `configuration`: a JSON object describing configuration values
        - `dependencies`: a JSON object describing dependency settings
        - `source`: a fully qualified URL or an absolute path on the server's file system

        When using multipart data, the `source` field can also alternatively be a file field
        containing either a zip bundle or a standalone JavaScript file.

        When using a standalone JavaScript file the given file will be executed
        to define our service's HTTP endpoints. It is the same which would be defined
        in the field `main` of the service manifest.

        If `source` is a URL, the URL must be reachable from the server.
        If `source` is a file system path, the path will be resolved on the server.
        In either case the path or URL is expected to resolve to a zip bundle,
        JavaScript file or (in case of a file system path) directory.

        Note that when using file system paths in a cluster with multiple Coordinators
        the file system path must resolve to equivalent files on every Coordinator.

### Run the service tests

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/foxx/tests:
    post:
      operationId: runFoxxTests
      description: |
        Runs the tests for the service at the given mount path and returns the results.

        Supported test reporters are:

        - `default`: a simple list of test cases
        - `suite`: an object of test cases nested in suites
        - `stream`: a raw stream of test results
        - `xunit`: an XUnit/JUnit compatible structure
        - `tap`: a raw TAP compatible stream

        The `Accept` request header can be used to further control the response format:

        When using the `stream` reporter `application/x-ldjson` will result
        in the response body being formatted as a newline-delimited JSON stream.

        When using the `tap` reporter `text/plain` or `text/*` will result
        in the response body being formatted as a plain text TAP report.

        When using the `xunit` reporter `application/xml` or `text/xml` will result
        in the response body being formatted as XML instead of JSONML.

        Otherwise the response body will be formatted as non-prettyprinted JSON.
      parameters:
        - name: mount
          in: query
          required: true
          description: |
            Mount path of the installed service.
          schema:
            type: string

          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Test reporter to use.
          schema:
            type: string
        - name: idiomatic
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Use the matching format for the reporter, regardless of the `Accept` header.

            type: boolean
        - name: filter
          in: query

### Enable the development mode

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/foxx/development:
    post:
      operationId: enableFoxxDevelopmentMode
      description: |
        Puts the service into development mode.

        While the service is running in development mode the service will be reloaded
        from the filesystem and its setup script (if any) will be re-executed every
        time the service handles a request.

        When running ArangoDB in a cluster with multiple Coordinators note that changes
        to the filesystem on one Coordinator will not be reflected across the other
        Coordinators. This means you should treat your Coordinators as inconsistent
        as long as any service is running in development mode.
      parameters:
        - name: mount
          in: query
          required: true
          description: |
            Mount path of the installed service.
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |

### Disable the development mode

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/foxx/development:
    delete:
      operationId: disableFoxxDevelopmentMode
      description: |
        Puts the service at the given mount path into production mode.

        When running ArangoDB in a cluster with multiple Coordinators this will
        replace the service on all other Coordinators with the version on this
        Coordinator.
      parameters:
        - name: mount
          in: query
