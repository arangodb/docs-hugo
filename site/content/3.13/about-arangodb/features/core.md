---
## General

- [**Graph Database**](../../concepts/data-models.md#graph-model):
  Native support for storing and querying graphs comprised of vertices and edges.
  You can model complex domains because edges are documents without any
  restrictions in complexity.

- [**Document Database**](../../concepts/data-models.md#document-model):
  A modern document database system that allows you to model data intuitively
  and evolve the data model easily. Documents can be organized in collections,
  and collections in databases for multi-tenancy.

- **Native Multi-model**:
  The capabilities of a graph database, a document database, a key-value store
  in one C++ core with a unified query language for a lower TCO (total cost of
  ownership). Easily change the data access strategy or even combine all
  supported data models in a single query. Add full-text search with ranking on
  top and mix it with graph traversals, geo queries, aggregations, or any other
  supported access pattern.

- [**Data Format**](../../concepts/data-structure/_index.md#documents):
  JSON, internally stored in a binary format invented by ArangoDB called
  VelocyPack.

- **Schema-free**:
  Flexible data modeling without having to define a schema upfront.
  Model your data as combination of key-value pairs,
  documents, or graphs - perfect for social relations. Optional document
  validation using JSON Schema (draft-4, without remote schema support).

- [**Data Storage**](../../components/arangodb-server/storage-engine.md):
  RocksDB storage engine to persist data and indexes on disk, with a hot set in
  memory. It uses journaling (write-ahead logging) and can take advantage of
  modern storage hardware, like SSDs and large caches.

- [**Computed Values**](../../concepts/data-structure/documents/computed-values.md):
  Persistent document attributes that are generated when documents are created
  or modified, using an AQL expression.

- [**In the cloud or on-prem**](../features/_index.md#on-premises-versus-cloud):
  Use ArangoDB as a [fully managed service](https://dashboard.arangodb.cloud/home?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=cluster_pages&utm_campaign=docs_traffic),
  self-managed in the cloud, or on-premises.

- [**Multiple Environments**](../../operations/installation/_index.md#supported-platforms-and-architectures):
  Run ArangoDB on Linux using the production-ready packages for the x86-64
  architecture, on bare metal or in containers.
  Develop and test with ArangoDB on Windows, macOS, and Linux using the official
  ArangoDB Docker images, available for the x86-64 architecture and 64-bit ARM chips.

## Scalability & High Availability

- [**Hash-based sharding**](../../deploy/architecture/data-sharding.md):
  Spread bigger datasets across multiple servers using consistent hashing on
  the default or custom shard keys.

- [**Synchronous Replication**](../../deploy/cluster/_index.md#synchronous-replication):
  Data changes are propagated to other cluster nodes immediately as part of an
  operation, and are only considered successful when the configured number of writes
  is reached. Synchronous replication works on a per-shard basis. For each
  collection, you can configure how many copies of each shard are kept in the cluster.

- [**Automatic Failover Cluster**](../../deploy/cluster/_index.md#automatic-failover):
  If a node goes down, another node takes over to avoid any downtime. <!-- TODO: Can we say that? -->

{{% comment %}}
  TODO: - **Master/Master Conflict Resolution**: What does this refer to? How does it work? MVCC?
{{% /comment %}}

- **Load-Balancer Support**:
  Round-robin load-balancer support for cloud environments.

- **High-performance Request Handling**:
  Low-latency request handling using a boost-ASIO server infrastructure.

## Querying

- [**Declarative Query Language for All Data Models**](../../aql/_index.md):
  Powerful query language (AQL) to retrieve and modify data.
  Graph traversals, full-text searches, geo-spatial queries, and aggregations
  can be composed in a single query.
  Support for sliding window queries to aggregate adjacent documents, value
  ranges and time intervals.
  Cluster-distributed aggregation queries.

- [**Query Optimizer**](../../aql/execution-and-performance/query-optimization.md):
  Cost-based query optimizer that takes index selectivity estimates into account.
  <!-- TODO: Explain, batching?, lazy evaluation (stream)? -->

- [**Query Profiling**](../../aql/execution-and-performance/query-profiling.md):
  Show detailed runtime information for AQL queries.

- [**Query Logging**](../../aql/execution-and-performance/query-logging.md):
  Store query metadata and analyze it directly in the database system to debug
  issues and understand usage patterns.

- [**Upsert Operations**](../../aql/examples-and-query-patterns/upsert-repsert-guide.md):
  Support for insert-or-update (upsert), insert-or-replace (repsert), and
  insert-or-ignore requests, that result in one or the other operation depending
  on whether the target document exists already.

- **Graph Relations**:
  Edges can connect vertex and even edge documents to express complex m:n
  relations with any depth, creating graphs and hyper-graphs.
  <!-- TODO: does this refer to the data model, graph traversals, or something else? -->

- [**Relational Joins**](../../aql/examples-and-query-patterns/joins.md):
  Joins similar to those in relational database systems can be leveraged to
  match up documents from different collections, allowing normalized data models.

- **Advanced Path-Finding with Multiple Algorithms**:
  Graphs can be [traversed](../../aql/graphs/traversals-explained.md) with AQL to
  retrieve direct and indirect neighbor nodes using a fixed or variable depth.
  The [traversal order](../../aql/graphs/traversals.md) can be
  depth-first, breadth-first, or in order of increasing edge weights
  ("Weighted Traversals"). Stop conditions for pruning paths are supported.
  Traversal algorithms to get a [shortest path](../../aql/graphs/shortest-path.md),
  [all shortest paths](../../aql/graphs/all-shortest-paths.md), paths in order of
  increasing length ("[k Shortest Paths](../../aql/graphs/k-shortest-paths.md)"),
  and to enumerate all paths between two vertices
  ("[k Paths](../../aql/graphs/k-paths.md)") are available, too.

- [**ArangoSearch for Text Search and Ranking**](../../index-and-search/arangosearch/_index.md):
  A built-in search engine for full-text, complex data structures, and more.
  Exact value matching, range queries, prefix matching, case-insensitive and
  accent-insensitive search. Token, phrase, wildcard, and fuzzy search support
  for full-text. Result ranking using Okapi BM25 and TF-IDF.
  Geo-spatial search that can be combined with full-text search.
  Flexible data field pre-processing with custom queries and the ability to
  chain built-in and custom Analyzers. Language-agnostic tokenization of text.

- [**GeoJSON Support**](../../aql/functions/geo.md#geojson):
  Geographic data encoded in the popular GeoJSON format can be stored and used
  for geo-spatial queries.

{{% comment %}} Experimental feature
- [**Query result spillover**](../../aql/how-to-invoke-aql/with-arangosh.md#spilloverthresholdmemoryusage):
  AQL queries can store intermediate and final results temporarily on disk
  (also known as external result sets) to decrease memory usage when a specified
  threshold is reached.

- **[`classification`](../../index-and-search/analyzers.md#classification) and [`nearest_neighbors` Analyzers](../../index-and-search/analyzers.md#nearest_neighbors)**:
  Classification of text tokens and finding similar tokens using supervised
  fastText word embedding models.
{{% /comment %}}

- [**Skip inaccessible collections**](../../aql/how-to-invoke-aql/with-arangosh.md#skipinaccessiblecollections):
  Let AQL queries like graph traversals pretend that collections are empty if
  the user has no access to them instead of failing the query.

## Transactions

- [**AQL Queries**](../../aql/data-queries.md#transactional-execution):
  AQL queries are executed transactionally (with exceptions), either committing
  or rolling back data modifications automatically.

- [**Stream Transactions**](../../develop/http-api/transactions/stream-transactions.md):
  Transactions with individual begin and commit / abort commands that can span
  multiple AQL queries and API calls of supported APIs.

- [**JavaScript Transactions**](../../develop/http-api/transactions/javascript-transactions.md):
  Single-request transactions written in JavaScript that leverage ArangoDB's
  JavaScript API.

- **Multi-Document Transactions**:
  Transactions are not limited to single documents, but can involve many
  documents of a collection.

- **Multi-Collection Transactions**
  A single transaction can modify the documents of multiple collections.
  There is an automatic deadlock detection for single servers.

- **ACID Transactions**:
  Using single servers, multi-document / multi-collection queries are guaranteed
  to be fully ACID (atomic, consistent, isolated, durable).
  Using cluster deployments, single-document operations are fully ACID, too.
  Multi-document queries in a cluster are not ACID, except for collections with
  a single shard. Multi-collection queries require the OneShard
  feature to be ACID. <!-- TODO: can we put it like this? -->

  Indexes can be created in the background to not block queries in the meantime.

- [**Index cache refilling**](../../release-notes/version-3.11/whats-new-in-3-11.md#index-cache-refilling):
  In-memory index caches are automatically repopulated after writes that affect
  an edge index or cache-enabled persistent indexes to maximize cache hits and
  thus query performance.

- [**Extensive Query Optimization**](../../aql/execution-and-performance/query-optimization.md):
  Late document materialization to only fetch the relevant documents from
