## HTTP RESTful API

### Batch request endpoint removed

<small>Removed in: v3.12.3</small>

The `/_api/batch` endpoints that let you send multiple operations in a single
HTTP request was deprecated in v3.8.0 and has now been removed.

To send multiple documents at once to an ArangoDB instance, please use the
[HTTP interface for documents](../../develop/http-api/documents.md#multiple-document-operations)
that can insert, update, replace, or remove arrays of documents.

## JavaScript API



## Startup options



## Client tools

### arangobench

#### Batch size option removed

<small>Removed in: v3.12.3</small>

The `--batch-size` startup option is now ignored by arangobench and no longer
has an effect. It allowed you to specify the number of operations to issue in
one batch but the batch request API has been removed on the server-side.
