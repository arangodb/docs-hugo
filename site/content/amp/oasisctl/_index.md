_oasisctl_ is a command-line tool for using the [Arango Management Platform (AMP) API](../api/_index.md).
This tool makes integration of AMP in all kinds of (bash) scripts easy.
It is also a good example on how to use the API.

See [Getting started with oasisctl](../api/get-started.md) for a
tutorial.
