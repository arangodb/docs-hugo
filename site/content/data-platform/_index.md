The Arango Data Platform is a **Kubernetes-native** technical infrastructure that acts as the umbrella
for hosting the entire ArangoDB offering of products. Built from the ground up for 
cloud-native orchestration, the platform leverages the power of Kubernetes to make it easy
to deploy, scale, and operate the core ArangoDB database system along with any additional
AI solutions for GraphRAG, graph machine learning, data explorations, and more. You can
run it on-premises or in the cloud yourself on top of Kubernetes to access all
of the platform features with enterprise-grade automation and reliability.
