  A LangChain integration for using LLMs to provide a natural language interface
  for the data stored in ArangoDB
---
[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a framework for developing applications
powered by language models.

LangChain enables applications that are:
- Data-aware (connect a language model to other sources of data)
- Agentic (allow a language model to interact with its environment)

The ArangoDB integration with LangChain provides you the ability to analyze
data seamlessly via natural language, eliminating the need for query language
design. By using LLM chat models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, you can "speak" to
your data instead of querying it.

## Get started with ArangoDB QA chain

The [ArangoDB QA chain notebook](https://langchain-langchain.vercel.app/docs/integrations/graphs/arangodb/)
shows how to use LLMs to provide a natural language interface to an ArangoDB
instance.

Run the notebook directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/arangodb/interactive_tutorials/blob/master/notebooks/Langchain.ipynb).
