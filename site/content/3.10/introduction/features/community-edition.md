The Community Edition features are outlined below. For additional information,
see [arangodb.com/community-server/](https://www.arangodb.com/community-server/).

## General

- [**Graph Database**](../../concepts/data-models.md#graph-model):
  Native support for storing and querying graphs comprised of vertices and edges.
  You can model complex domains because edges are documents without any
  restrictions in complexity.

- [**Document Database**](../../concepts/data-models.md#document-model):
  A modern document database system that allows you to model data intuitively
  and evolve the data model easily. Documents can be organized in collections,
  and collections in databases for multi-tenancy.

- [**Data Format**](../../concepts/data-structure/_index.md#documents):
  JSON, internally stored in a binary format invented by ArangoDB called
  VelocyPack.

- **Schema-free**:
  Flexible data modeling without having to define a schema upfront.
  Model your data as combination of key-value pairs,
  documents, or graphs - perfect for social relations. Optional document
  validation using JSON Schema (draft-4, without remote schema support).

- [**Data Storage**](../../deploy/architecture/storage-engine.md):
  RocksDB storage engine to persist data and indexes on disk, with a hot set in
  memory. It uses journaling (write-ahead logging) and can take advantage of
  modern storage hardware, like SSDs and large caches.

- [**Computed Values**](../../concepts/data-structure/documents/computed-values.md):
  Persistent document attributes that are generated when documents are created
  or modified, using an AQL expression.

- [**Multiple Environments**](../../operations/installation/_index.md#supported-platforms-and-architectures):
  Use ArangoDB as a [managed service](https://cloud.arangodb.com),
  in your own cloud, or on-premises.
  Develop and test with ArangoDB on Linux, macOS, and Windows, and run it in
  production on Linux. ArangoDB is available for 64-bit ARM chips on macOS and
  Linux as well as for the x86-64 architecture.

## Scalability & High Availability

- [**Hash-based sharding**](../../deploy/architecture/data-sharding.md):
  Spread bigger datasets across multiple servers using consistent hashing on
  the default or custom shard keys.

- [**Synchronous Replication**](../../deploy/deployment/cluster/_index.md#synchronous-replication):
  Data changes are propagated to other cluster nodes immediately as part of an
  operation, and only considered successful when the configured number of writes
  is reached. Synchronous replication works on a per-shard basis. For each
  collection, you can configure how many copies of each shard are kept in the cluster.

- [**Active Failover**](../../deploy/deployment/active-failover/_index.md):
  Run a single server with asynchronous replication to one or more passive
  single servers for automatic failover.

- [**Automatic Failover Cluster**](../../deploy/deployment/cluster/_index.md#automatic-failover):
  If a nodes goes down, another node takes over to avoid any downtime. <!-- TODO: Can we say that? -->

- **Load-Balancer Support**:
  Round-robin load-balancer support for cloud environments.

- **High-performance Request Handling**:
  Low-latency request handling using a boost-ASIO server infrastructure.

## Querying

- [**Declarative Query Language for All Data Models**](../../aql/_index.md):
  Powerful query language (AQL) to retrieve and modify data.
  Graph traversals, full-text searches, geo-spatial queries, and aggregations
  can be composed in a single query.
  Support for sliding window queries to aggregate adjacent documents, value
  ranges and time intervals.
  Cluster-distributed aggregation queries.

- [**Query Optimizer**](../../aql/execution-and-performance/query-optimization.md):
  Cost-based query optimizer that takes index selectivity estimates into account.
  <!-- TODO: Explain, batching?, lazy evaluation (stream)? -->

- [**Query Profiling**](../../aql/execution-and-performance/query-profiling.md):
  Show detailed runtime information for AQL queries.

- [**Upsert Operations**](../../aql/examples-and-query-patterns/upsert-repsert-guide.md):
  Support for insert-or-update (upsert), insert-or-replace (repsert), and
  insert-or-ignore requests, that result in one or the other operation depending
  on whether the target document exists already.

- **Graph Relations**:
  Edges can connect vertex and even edge documents to express complex m:n
  relations with any depth, creating graphs and hyper-graphs.
  <!-- TODO: does this refer to the data model, graph traversals, or something else? -->

- [**Relational Joins**](../../aql/examples-and-query-patterns/joins.md):
  Joins similar to those in relational database systems can be leveraged to
  match up documents from different collections, allowing normalized data models.

- **Advanced Path-Finding with Multiple Algorithms**:
  Graphs can be [traversed](../../aql/graphs/traversals-explained.md) with AQL to
  retrieve direct and indirect neighbor nodes using a fixed or variable depth.
  The [traversal order](../../aql/graphs/traversals.md) can be
  depth-first, breadth-first, or in order of increasing edge weights
  ("Weighted Traversals"). Stop conditions for pruning paths are supported.
  Traversal algorithms to get a [shortest path](../../aql/graphs/shortest-path.md),
  [all shortest paths](../../aql/graphs/all-shortest-paths.md), paths in order of
  increasing length ("[k Shortest Paths](../../aql/graphs/k-shortest-paths.md)"),
  and to enumerate all paths between two vertices
  ("[k Paths](../../aql/graphs/k-paths.md)") are available, too.

- [**Pregel**](../../data-science/pregel/_index.md):
  Iterative graph processing for single servers with pre-built algorithms like
  PageRank, Connected Components, and Label Propagation. Cluster support
  requires the Enterprise Edition.

- [**ArangoSearch for Text Search and Ranking**](../../index-and-search/arangosearch/_index.md):
  A built-in search engine for full-text, complex data structures, and more.
  Exact value matching, range queries, prefix matching, case-insensitive and
  accent-insensitive search. Token, phrase, wildcard, and fuzzy search support
  for full-text. Result ranking using Okapi BM25 and TF-IDF.
  Geo-spatial search that can be combined with full-text search.
  Flexible data field pre-processing with custom queries and the ability to
  chain built-in and custom Analyzers. Language-agnostic tokenization of text.

- [**GeoJSON Support**](../../index-and-search/indexing/working-with-indexes/geo-spatial-indexes.md#geojson):
  Geographic data encoded in the popular GeoJSON format can be stored and used
  for geo-spatial queries.

{{% comment %}} Experimental feature
- [**Query result spillover**](../../aql/how-to-invoke-aql/with-arangosh.md#spilloverthresholdmemoryusage)
  AQL queries can store intermediate and final results temporarily on disk
  (also known as external result sets) to decrease memory usage when a specified
  threshold is reached.

## Transactions

- [**AQL Queries**](../../aql/data-queries.md#transactional-execution):
  AQL queries are executed transactionally (with exceptions), either committing
  or rolling back data modifications automatically.

- [**Stream Transactions**](../../develop/http/transactions/stream-transactions.md):
  Transactions with individual begin and commit / abort commands that can span
  multiple AQL queries and API calls of supported APIs.

- [**JavaScript Transactions**](../../develop/http/transactions/javascript-transactions.md):
  Single-request transactions written in JavaScript that leverage ArangoDB's
  JavaScript API.

- **Multi-Document Transactions**:
  Transactions are not limited to single documents, but can involve many
  documents of a collection.

- **Multi-Collection Transactions**
  A single transaction can modify the documents of multiple collections.
  There is an automatic deadlock detection for single servers.

- **ACID Transactions**:
  Using single servers, multi-document / multi-collection queries are guaranteed
  to be fully ACID (atomic, consistent, isolated, durable).
  Using cluster deployments, single-document operations are fully ACID, too.
  Multi-document queries in a cluster are not ACID, except for collections with
  a single shard. Multi-collection queries require the OneShard
  feature of the Enterprise Edition to be ACID. <!-- TODO: can we put it like this? -->

## Performance

- [**Persistent Indexes**](../../index-and-search/indexing/index-basics.md#persistent-index):
  Indexes are stored on disk to enable fast server restarts. You can create
  secondary indexes over one or multiple fields, optionally with a uniqueness
  constraint. A "sparse" option to only index non-null values is also available.
  The elements of an array can be indexed individually.

- [**Inverted indexes**](../../index-and-search/indexing/working-with-indexes/inverted-indexes.md):
  An eventually consistent index type that can accelerate a broad range of
  queries from simple to complex, including full-text search.

- [**Vertex-centric Indexes**](../../index-and-search/indexing/index-basics.md#vertex-centric-indexes):
  Secondary indexes for more efficient graph traversals with filter conditions.

- [**Time-to-Live (TTL) Indexes**](../../index-and-search/indexing/index-basics.md#ttl-time-to-live-index):
  Time-based removal of expired documents.

- [**Geo-spatial Indexes**](../../index-and-search/indexing/index-basics.md#geo-index):
  Accelerated geo-spatial queries for locations and GeoJSON objects, based on
  the S2 library. <!-- TODO: list supported queries? Centroid-limitations? -->
  Support for composable, distance-based geo-queries ("geo cursors").

{{% comment %}} Experimental feature
- [**Multi-dimensional indexes**](../../index-and-search/indexing/working-with-indexes/multi-dimensional-indexes.md):
  An index type to efficiently intersect multiple range queries, like finding
  all appointments that intersect a time range.
{{% /comment %}}

- [**Background Indexing**](../../index-and-search/indexing/index-basics.md#creating-indexes-in-background):
  Indexes can be created in the background to not block queries in the meantime.

- [**Extensive Query Optimization**](../../aql/execution-and-performance/query-optimization.md):
  Late document materialization to only fetch the relevant documents from
  SORT/LIMIT queries. Early pruning of non-matching documents in full
  collection scans. Inlining of certain subqueries to improve execution time.
  <!-- TODO, move to Querying? -->

## Extensibility
