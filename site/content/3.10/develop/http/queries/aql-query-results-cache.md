## List the entries of the AQL query results cache

paths:
  /_api/query-cache/entries:
    get:
      operationId: listQueryCacheResults
      description: |
        Returns an array containing the AQL query results currently stored in the query results
        cache of the selected database. Each result is a JSON object with the following attributes:

        - `hash`: the query result's hash
        - `query`: the query string
        - `bindVars`: the query's bind parameters. this attribute is only shown if tracking for
          bind variables was enabled at server start
        - `size`: the size of the query result and bind parameters, in bytes
        - `results`: number of documents/rows in the query result
        - `started`: the date and time when the query was stored in the cache
        - `hits`: number of times the result was served from the cache (can be
          `0` for queries that were only stored in the cache but were never accessed
          again afterwards)
        - `runTime`: the query's run time
        - `dataSources`: an array of collections/Views the query was using
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |
            Is returned when the list of results can be retrieved successfully.
        '400':
          description: |
            The server will respond with *HTTP 400* in case of a malformed request,

        - Queries

## Clear the AQL query results cache

paths:
  /_api/query-cache:
    delete:
      operationId: deleteAqlQueryCache
      description: |
        Clears all results stored in the AQL query results cache for the current database.
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |
            The server will respond with *HTTP 200* when the cache was cleared
            successfully.

## Get the AQL query results cache configuration

paths:
  /_api/query-cache/properties:
    get:
      operationId: getQueryCacheProperties
      description: |
        Returns the global AQL query results cache configuration. The configuration is a
        JSON object with the following properties:

        - `mode`: the mode the AQL query results cache operates in. The mode is one of the following
          values: `off`, `on`, or `demand`.

        - `maxResults`: the maximum number of query results that will be stored per database-specific
          cache.

        - `maxResultsSize`: the maximum cumulated size of query results that will be stored per
          database-specific cache.

        - `maxEntrySize`: the maximum individual result size of queries that will be stored per
          database-specific cache.

        - `includeSystem`: whether or not results of queries that involve system collections will be
          stored in the query results cache.
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |
            Is returned if the properties can be retrieved successfully.
        '400':

## Set the AQL query results cache configuration

paths:
  /_api/query-cache/properties:
    put:
      operationId: setQueryCacheProperties
      description: |
        Adjusts the global properties for the AQL query results cache.

        After the properties have been changed, the current set of properties will
        be returned in the HTTP response.

        Note: changing the properties may invalidate all results in the cache.

        The properties need to be passed in the `properties` attribute in the body
        of the HTTP request. `properties` needs to be a JSON object with the following
        properties:
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:

                mode:
                  description: |
                     the mode the AQL query cache should operate in. Possible values are `off`, `on`, or `demand`.
                  type: string
                maxResults:
                  description: |
                    the maximum number of query results that will be stored per database-specific cache.

                maxEntrySize:
                  description: |
                    the maximum individual size of query results that will be stored per database-specific cache.

                  description: |
                    whether or not to store results of queries that involve system collections.
