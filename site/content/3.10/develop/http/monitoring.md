### Get the global server logs

paths:
  /_admin/log/entries:
    get:
      operationId: getLogEntries
      description: |
        Returns fatal, error, warning or info log messages from the server's global log.
        The result is a JSON object with the following properties:

        - **total**: the total amount of log entries before pagination
        - **messages**: an array with log messages that matched the criteria

        This API can be turned off via the startup option `--log.api-enabled`. In case
        the API is disabled, all requests will be responded to with HTTP 403. If the
        API is enabled, accessing it requires admin privileges, or even superuser
        privileges, depending on the value of the `--log.api-enabled` startup option.

### Set the server log levels

paths:
  /_admin/log/level:
    put:
      operationId: setLogLevel
      description: |
        Modifies and returns the server's current log level settings.
        The request body must be a JSON string with a log level or a JSON object with the
        log topics being the object keys and the log levels being the object values.

        If only a JSON string is specified as input, the log level is adjusted for the
        "general" log topic only. If a JSON object is specified as input, the log levels will
        be set only for the log topic mentioned in the input object, but preserved for every
        other log topic.
        To set the log level for all log levels to a specific value, it is possible to hand
        in the special pseudo log topic "all".

        The result is a JSON object with all available log topics being the object keys, and
        the adjusted log levels being the object values.

        Possible log levels are:
        - FATAL - There will be no way out of this. ArangoDB will go down after this message.
        - ERROR - This is an error. you should investigate and fix it. It may harm your production.
        - WARNING - This may be serious application-wise, but we don't know.
        - INFO - Something has happened, take notice, but no drama attached.
        - DEBUG - output debug messages
        - TRACE - trace - prepare your log to be flooded - don't use in production.

        This API can be turned off via the startup option `--log.api-enabled`. In case
        the API is disabled, all requests will be responded to with HTTP 403. If the
        API is enabled, accessing it requires admin privileges, or even superuser
        privileges, depending on the value of the `--log.api-enabled` startup option.

### Get the structured log settings

        Returns the server's current structured log settings.
        The result is a JSON object with the log parameters being the object keys, and
        `true` or `false` being the object values, meaning the parameters are either
        enabled or disabled.

        This API can be turned off via the startup option `--log.api-enabled`. In case
        the API is disabled, all requests will be responded to with HTTP 403. If the
        API is enabled, accessing it requires admin privileges, or even superuser
        privileges, depending on the value of the `--log.api-enabled` startup option.

## Statistics

```openapi
### Get the statistics

paths:
  /_admin/statistics:
    get:
      operationId: getStatistics
      description: |
        {{</* warning */>}}
        This endpoint should no longer be used. It is deprecated from version 3.8.0 on.
        Use `/_admin/metrics/v2` instead, which provides the data exposed by this API
        and a lot more.
        {{</* /warning */>}}

        Returns the statistics information. The returned object contains the
        statistics figures grouped together according to the description returned by
        `/_admin/statistics-description`. For instance, to access a figure `userTime`
        from the group `system`, you first select the sub-object describing the
        group stored in `system` and in that sub-object the value for `userTime` is
        stored in the attribute of the same name.

        In case of a distribution, the returned object contains the total count in
        `count` and the distribution list in `counts`. The sum (or total) of the
        individual values is returned in `sum`.

        The transaction statistics show the local started, committed and aborted
        transactions as well as intermediate commits done for the server queried. The
        intermediate commit count will only take non zero values for the RocksDB
        storage engine. Coordinators do almost no local transactions themselves in
        their local databases, therefor cluster transactions (transactions started on a
        Coordinator that require DB-Servers to finish before the transactions is
        committed cluster wide) are just added to their local statistics. This means
        that the statistics you would see for a single server is roughly what you can
        expect in a cluster setup using a single Coordinator querying this Coordinator.
        Just with the difference that cluster transactions have no notion of
        intermediate commits and will not increase the value.

## Metrics

_arangod_ exports metrics in the
[Prometheus format](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/){:taget="_blank"}.
You can use these metrics to monitor the healthiness and performance of the
system. The thresholds for alerts are also described for relevant metrics.

{{< warning >}}
The list of exposed metrics is subject to change in every minor version.
While they should stay backwards compatible for the most part, some metrics are
coupled to specific internals that may be replaced by other mechanisms in the
future.

        Returns the instance's current metrics in Prometheus format. The

        at any given time and exposes them for collection by Prometheus.

        The document contains different metrics and metrics groups dependent
        on the role of the queried instance. All exported metrics are
        published with the prefix `arangodb_` or `rocksdb_` to distinguish them from
        other collected data.

        The API then needs to be added to the Prometheus configuration file
        for collection.
