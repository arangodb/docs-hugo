  The HTTP API for collections lets you create and delete collections, get
  information about collections, and modify certain properties of existing
  collections
archetype: default

## Addresses of collections

All collections in ArangoDB have a unique identifier and a unique
name. To access a collection, use the collection name to refer to it:

```
http://server:port/_api/collection/<collection-name>
```

For example, assume that the collection identifier is `7254820` and
the collection name is `demo`, then the URL of that collection is:

```
http://localhost:8529/_api/collection/demo
```

## Get information about collections

### List all collections

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/collection:
    get:
      operationId: listCollections
      description: |
        Returns an object with a `result` attribute containing an array with the
        descriptions of all collections in the current database.

        By providing the optional `excludeSystem` query parameter with a value of
        `true`, all system collections are excluded from the response.
      parameters:
        - name: excludeSystem
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |
            Whether or not system collections should be excluded from the result.
          schema:
            type: boolean
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |
            The list of collections
      tags:
        - Collections
```

**Examples**

```curl
---
description: |-
  Return information about all collections:
name: RestCollectionGetAllCollections
---
var url = "/_api/collection";

var response = logCurlRequest('GET', url);

assert(response.code === 200);

logJsonResponse(response);
```

### Get the collection information

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/collection/{collection-name}:
    get:
      operationId: getCollection
      description: |
        {{</* warning */>}}
        Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
        You should reference them via their names instead.
        {{</* /warning */>}}

        The result is an object describing the collection with the following
        attributes:

        - `id`: The identifier of the collection.

        - `name`: The name of the collection.

        - `status`: The status of the collection as number.
          - 3: loaded
          - 5: deleted

        Every other status indicates a corrupted collection.

        - `type`: The type of the collection as number.
          - 2: document collection (normal case)
          - 3: edge collection

        - `isSystem`: If `true` then the collection is a system collection.
      parameters:
        - name: collection-name
          in: path
          required: true
          description: |
            The name of the collection.
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        '404':
          description: |
            If the `collection-name` is unknown, then a *HTTP 404* is
            returned.
      tags:
        - Collections
```

### Get the properties of a collection

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/collection/{collection-name}/properties:
    get:
      operationId: getCollectionProperties
      description: |
        {{</* warning */>}}
        Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
        You should reference them via their names instead.
        {{</* /warning */>}}

        Returns all properties of the specified collection.
      parameters:
        - name: collection-name
          in: path
          required: true

### Get the collection revision ID

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/collection/{collection-name}/revision:
    get:

        {{</* /warning */>}}

        The response will contain the collection's latest used revision id.
        The revision id is a server-generated string that clients can use to
        check whether data in a collection has changed since the last revision check.

        - `revision`: The collection revision id as a string.
      parameters:

**Examples**

var cn = "products";
db._drop(cn);
var coll = db._create(cn, { waitForSync: false });

var response = logCurlRequest('GET', url);

assert(response.code === 200);

logJsonResponse(response);
db._drop(cn);

### Get the collection checksum

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/collection/{collection-name}/checksum:
    get:
      operationId: getCollectionChecksum
      description: |
        {{</* warning */>}}
        Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
        You should reference them via their names instead.
        {{</* /warning */>}}

        Will calculate a checksum of the meta-data (keys and optionally revision ids) and
        optionally the document data in the collection.

        The checksum can be used to compare if two collections on different ArangoDB
        instances contain the same contents. The current revision of the collection is
        returned too so one can make sure the checksums are calculated for the same
        state of data.

        By default, the checksum will only be calculated on the `_key` system attribute
        of the documents contained in the collection. For edge collections, the system
        attributes `_from` and `_to` will also be included in the calculation.

        By setting the optional query parameter `withRevisions` to `true`, then revision
        ids (`_rev` system attributes) are included in the checksumming.

        By providing the optional query parameter `withData` with a value of `true`,
        the user-defined document attributes will be included in the calculation too.
        **Note**: Including user-defined attributes will make the checksumming slower.

        The response is a JSON object with the following attributes:

        - `checksum`: The calculated checksum as a number.

        - `revision`: The collection revision id as a string.
      parameters:
        - name: collection-name

                      description: |
                        specifies the type of the key generator. The currently available generators are
                        `traditional`, `autoincrement`, `uuid` and `padded`.

                        - The `traditional` key generator generates numerical keys in ascending order.
                          The sequence of keys is not guaranteed to be gap-free.

                        - The `autoincrement` key generator generates numerical keys in ascending order,
                          the initial offset and the spacing can be configured (**note**: `autoincrement`
                          is currently only supported for non-sharded collections).
                          The sequence of generated keys is not guaranteed to be gap-free, because a new key
                          will be generated on every document insert attempt, not just for successful
                          inserts.

                        - The `padded` key generator generates keys of a fixed length (16 bytes) in
                          ascending lexicographical sort order. This is ideal for usage with the _RocksDB_
                          engine, which will slightly benefit keys that are inserted in lexicographically
                          ascending order. The key generator can be used in a single-server or cluster.
                          The sequence of generated keys is not guaranteed to be gap-free.

                        - The `uuid` key generator generates universally unique 128 bit keys, which
                          are stored in hexadecimal human-readable format. This key generator can be used
                          in a single-server or cluster to generate "seemingly random" keys. The keys
                          produced by this key generator are not lexicographically sorted.

                        Please note that keys are only guaranteed to be truly ascending in single
                        server deployments and for collections that only have a single shard (that includes
                        collections in a OneShard database).
                        The reason is that for collections with more than a single shard, document keys
                        are generated on Coordinator(s). For collections with a single shard, the document
                        keys are generated on the leader DB-Server, which has full control over the key
                        sequence.

                        is solely be responsible for generating keys and an error is raised if you
                        supply own key values in the `_key` attribute of documents.

                        single shard. Mixing the two can lead to conflicts because Coordinators that
                        auto-generate keys in this case are not aware of all keys which are already used.

                    startup option. The cache can speed up repeated reads of the same documents via
                    their document keys. If the same documents are not fetched often or are
                    modified frequently, then you may disable the cache to avoid the maintenance
                    costs.

                    number of shards to create for the collection. In a single

                    which document attributes are used to determine the target shard for documents.
                    Documents are sent to shards based on the values of their shard key attributes.
                    The values of all shard key attributes in a document are hashed,
                    and the hash value is used to determine the target shard.
                    **Note**: Values of shard key attributes cannot be changed once set.
                      This option is meaningless in a single server setup.
                  type: string
                replicationFactor:
                  description: |
                    (The default is `1`): in a cluster, this attribute determines how many copies
                    of each shard are kept on different DB-Servers. The value 1 means that only one
                    copy (no synchronous replication) is kept. A value of k means that k-1 replicas
                    are kept. For SatelliteCollections, it needs to be the string `"satellite"`,
                    which matches the replication factor to the number of DB-Servers
                    (Enterprise Edition only).

                    Any two copies reside on different DB-Servers. Replication between them is
                    synchronous, that is, every write operation to the "leader" copy will be replicated
                    to all "follower" replicas, before the write operation is reported successful.

                    If a server fails, this is detected automatically and one of the servers holding
                    copies take over, usually without an error being reported.
                  type: integer
                writeConcern:
                  description: |
                    Write concern for this collection (default: 1).
                    It determines how many copies of each shard are required to be
                    in sync on the different DB-Servers. If there are less than these many copies
                    in the cluster, a shard refuses to write. Writes to shards with enough
                    up-to-date copies succeed at the same time, however. The value of
                    `writeConcern` cannot be greater than `replicationFactor`.
                    For SatelliteCollections, the `writeConcern` is automatically controlled to
                    equal the number of DB-Servers and has a value of `0`. _(cluster only)_
                  type: integer
                shardingStrategy:
                  description: |
                    This attribute specifies the name of the sharding strategy to use for
                    the collection. Since ArangoDB 3.4 there are different sharding strategies
                    to select from when creating a new collection. The selected `shardingStrategy`
                    value remains fixed for the collection and cannot be changed afterwards.
                    This is important to make the collection keep its sharding settings and
                    always find documents already distributed to shards using the same
                    initial sharding algorithm.

                    The available sharding strategies are:
                    - `community-compat`: default sharding used by ArangoDB
                      Community Edition before version 3.4
                    - `enterprise-compat`: default sharding used by ArangoDB
                      Enterprise Edition before version 3.4
                    - `enterprise-smart-edge-compat`: default sharding used by smart edge
                      collections in ArangoDB Enterprise Edition before version 3.4
                    - `hash`: default sharding used for new collections starting from version 3.4
                      (excluding smart edge collections)
                    - `enterprise-hash-smart-edge`: default sharding used for new
                      smart edge collections starting from version 3.4
                    - `enterprise-hex-smart-vertex`: sharding used for vertex collections of
                      EnterpriseGraphs

                    If no sharding strategy is specified, the default is `hash` for
                    all normal collections, `enterprise-hash-smart-edge` for all smart edge
                    collections, and `enterprise-hex-smart-vertex` for EnterpriseGraph
                    vertex collections (the latter two require the *Enterprise Edition* of ArangoDB).
                    Manually overriding the sharding strategy does not yet provide a
                    benefit, but it may later in case other sharding strategies are added.
                  type: string
                distributeShardsLike:
                  description: |
                    The name of another collection. If this property is set in a cluster, the
                    collection copies the `replicationFactor`, `numberOfShards` and `shardingStrategy`
                    properties from the specified collection (referred to as the _prototype collection_)
                    and distributes the shards of this collection in the same way as the shards of
                    the other collection. In an Enterprise Edition cluster, this data co-location is
                    utilized to optimize queries.

                    You need to use the same number of `shardKeys` as the prototype collection, but
                    you can use different attributes.

                    The default is `""`.

                    **Note**: Using this parameter has consequences for the prototype
                    collection. It can no longer be dropped, before the sharding-imitating
                    collections are dropped. Equally, backups and restores of imitating
                    collections alone generate warnings (which can be overridden)
                    about a missing sharding prototype.

                    of the collection that must contain the shard key value of the referred-to
                    SmartJoin collection. Additionally, the shard key for a document in this
                    collection must contain the value of this attribute, followed by a colon,
                    followed by the actual primary key of the document.

                    This feature can only be used in the *Enterprise Edition* and requires the
                    `distributeShardsLike` attribute of the collection to be set to the name
                    of another collection. It also requires the `shardKeys` attribute of the
                    collection to be set to a single shard key attribute, with an additional ':'
                    at the end.
                    A further restriction is that whenever documents are stored or updated in the
                    collection, the value stored in the `smartJoinAttribute` must be a string.

        The load function is deprecated from version 3.8.0 onwards and is a no-op
        from version 3.9.0 onwards. It should no longer be used, as it may be removed
        in a future version of ArangoDB.

        Since ArangoDB version 3.9.0 this API does nothing. Previously it used to
        load a collection into memory.

        The request body object might optionally contain the following attribute:

        - `count`: If set, this controls whether the return value should include
          the number of documents in the collection. Setting `count` to
          `false` may speed up loading a collection. The default value for
          `count` is `true`.

        A call to this API returns an object with the following attributes for
        compatibility reasons:

        - `id`: The identifier of the collection.

        - `name`: The name of the collection.

        - `count`: The number of documents inside the collection. This is only
          returned if the `count` input parameters is set to `true` or has
          not been specified.

        - `status`: The status of the collection as number.

        - `type`: The collection type. Valid types are:
          - 2: document collection
          - 3: edge collection

        - `isSystem`: If `true` then the collection is a system collection.

### Unload a collection

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/collection/{collection-name}/unload:
    put:
      operationId: unloadCollection
      description: |
        {{</* warning */>}}
        The unload function is deprecated from version 3.8.0 onwards and is a no-op
        from version 3.9.0 onwards. It should no longer be used, as it may be removed
        in a future version of ArangoDB.
        {{</* /warning */>}}

        {{</* warning */>}}
        Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
        You should reference them via their names instead.
        {{</* /warning */>}}

        Since ArangoDB version 3.9.0 this API does nothing. Previously it used to
        unload a collection from memory, while preserving all documents.
        When calling the API an object with the following attributes is
        returned for compatibility reasons:

        - `id`: The identifier of the collection.

        - `name`: The name of the collection.

        - `status`: The status of the collection as number.

        - `type`: The collection type. Valid types are:
          - 2: document collection
          - 3: edges collection

        - `isSystem`: If `true` then the collection is a system collection.

### Load collection indexes into memory

```openapi
paths:
  /_api/collection/{collection-name}/loadIndexesIntoMemory:
    put:
      operationId: loadCollectionIndexes
      description: |
        {{</* warning */>}}
        Accessing collections by their numeric ID is deprecated from version 3.4.0 on.
        You should reference them via their names instead.
        {{</* /warning */>}}

        You can call this endpoint to try to cache this collection's index entries in
        the main memory. Index lookups served from the memory cache can be much faster
        than lookups not stored in the cache, resulting in a performance boost.

        The endpoint iterates over suitable indexes of the collection and stores the
        indexed values (not the entire document data) in memory. This is implemented for
        edge indexes only.

        The endpoint returns as soon as the index warmup has been scheduled. The index
        warmup may still be ongoing in the background, even after the return value has
        already been sent. As all suitable indexes are scanned, it may cause significant
        I/O activity and background load.

        This feature honors memory limits. If the indexes you want to load are smaller
        than your memory limit, this feature guarantees that most index values are
        cached. If the index is greater than your memory limit, this feature fills
        up values up to this limit. You cannot control which indexes of the collection
        should have priority over others.

        It is guaranteed that the in-memory cache data is consistent with the stored
        index data at all times.

        On success, this endpoint returns an object with attribute `result` set to `true`.
      parameters:
        - name: collection-name
          in: path

        Changes the properties of a collection. Only the provided attributes are
        updated. Collection properties **cannot be changed** once a collection is
        created except for the listed properties, as well as the collection name via
        the rename endpoint (but not in clusters).

                    startup option. The cache can speed up repeated reads of the same documents via
                    their document keys. If the same documents are not fetched often or are
                    modified frequently, then you may disable the cache to avoid the maintenance

                  description: |
                    (The default is `1`): in a cluster, this attribute determines how many copies
                    of each shard are kept on different DB-Servers. The value 1 means that only one
                    copy (no synchronous replication) is kept. A value of k means that k-1 replicas
                    are kept. For SatelliteCollections, it needs to be the string `"satellite"`,
                    which matches the replication factor to the number of DB-Servers
                    (Enterprise Edition only).

                    Any two copies reside on different DB-Servers. Replication between them is
                    synchronous, that is, every write operation to the "leader" copy will be replicated
                    to all "follower" replicas, before the write operation is reported successful.

                    If a server fails, this is detected automatically and one of the servers holding
                    copies take over, usually without an error being reported.

                    It determines how many copies of each shard are required to be
                    in sync on the different DB-Servers. If there are less than these many copies
                    in the cluster, a shard refuses to write. Writes to shards with enough
                    up-to-date copies succeed at the same time, however. The value of
                    `writeConcern` cannot be greater than `replicationFactor`.
                    For SatelliteCollections, the `writeConcern` is automatically controlled to
                    equal the number of DB-Servers and has a value of `0`. _(cluster only)_

        The operation will compact the document and index data by rewriting the

        Under normal circumstances, running a compact operation is not necessary, as
        the collection data will eventually get compacted anyway. However, in some
        situations, e.g. after running lots of update/replace or remove operations,
        the disk data for a collection may contain a lot of outdated data for which the
        space shall be reclaimed. In this case the compaction operation can be used.
