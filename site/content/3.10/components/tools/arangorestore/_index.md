  `arangorestore` is a command-line client tool to restore backups to ArangoDB servers
archetype: chapter
---
_arangorestore_ can restore dumps created by [_arangodump_](../arangodump/_index.md)
and is therefore its counterpart.

If you want to import data in formats like JSON or CSV, see
[_arangoimport_](../arangoimport/_index.md) instead.

_arangorestore_ can restore selected collections or all collections of a backup,
optionally including _system_ collections. One can restore the structure, i.e.
the collections with their configuration with or without data.
Views can also be dumped or restored (either all of them or selectively).

In order to speed up the _arangorestore_ performance in a Cluster environment,
the [Fast Cluster Restore](fast-cluster-restore.md)
procedure is recommended.
