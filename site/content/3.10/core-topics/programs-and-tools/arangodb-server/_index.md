The ArangoDB server is the core component of ArangoDB. The executable file to
run it is named `arangod`. The `d` stands for daemon. A daemon is a long-running
background process that answers requests for services.

_arangod_ can run in different modes for a variety of setups like single server
and clusters. It differs between the [Community Edition](../../../getting-started/about-arangodb/features/community-edition.md)
and [Enterprise Edition](../../../getting-started/about-arangodb/features/enterprise-edition.md).

See [Administration](../../../operations/administration/_index.md) for server configuration
and [Deployment](../../../advanced-topics/deployment/_index.md) for operation mode details.
