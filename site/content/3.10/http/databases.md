  The HTTP API for databases lets you create and delete databases, list
  available databases, and get information about specific databases

{{< description >}}

The HTTP interface for databases provides operations to create and drop
individual databases. These are mapped to the standard `POST` and `DELETE`
HTTP methods. There is also the `GET` method to retrieve an array of existing
databases.

{{< info >}}
All database management operations can only be accessed via the default
`_system` database and none of the other databases.
{{< /info >}}

## Addresses of databases

Any operation triggered via ArangoDB's RESTful HTTP API is executed in the
context of exactly one database. To explicitly specify the database in a request,
the request URI must contain the database name before the actual path:

```
http://localhost:8529/_db/mydb/...
```

The `...` placeholder is the actual path to the accessed resource. In the example,
the resource is accessed in the context of the `mydb` database. Actual URLs in
the context of `mydb` could look like this:

```
http://localhost:8529/_db/mydb/_api/version
http://localhost:8529/_db/mydb/_api/document/test/12345
http://localhost:8529/_db/mydb/myapp/get
```

Special characters in database names must be properly URL-encoded, e.g.
`a + b = c` needs to be encoded as `a%20%2B%20b%20%3D%20c`:

```
http://localhost:8529/_db/a%20%2B%20b%20%3D%20c/_api/version
```

Database names containing Unicode must be properly
[NFC-normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence#Normal_forms).
Non-NFC-normalized names are rejected by the server.

## Manage databases

```openapi
### Get information about the current database

paths:
  /_api/database/current:
    get:
      operationId: getCurrentDatabase
      description: |
        Retrieves the properties of the current database

        The response is a JSON object with the following attributes:

        - `name`: the name of the current database
        - `id`: the id of the current database
        - `path`: the filesystem path of the current database
        - `isSystem`: whether or not the current database is the `_system` database
        - `sharding`: the default sharding method for collections created in this database
        - `replicationFactor`: the default replication factor for collections in this database
        - `writeConcern`: the default write concern for collections in this database
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |
            is returned if the information was retrieved successfully.
        '400':
          description: |
            is returned if the request is invalid.
        '404':
          description: |
            is returned if the database could not be found.
      tags:

        The response is a JSON object with the attribute `result` set to `true`.

                        are: "", "flexible", or "single". The first two are equivalent. _(cluster only)_

                        Default replication factor for new collections created in this database.
                        Special values include "satellite", which will replicate the collection to
                        every DB-Server (Enterprise Edition only), and 1, which disables replication.

                        Default write concern for new collections created in this database.
                        It determines how many copies of each shard are required to be
                        in sync on the different DB-Servers. If there are less than these many copies
                        in the cluster, a shard refuses to write. Writes to shards with enough
                        up-to-date copies succeed at the same time, however. The value of
                        `writeConcern` cannot be greater than `replicationFactor`.
                        For SatelliteCollections, the `writeConcern` is automatically controlled to
                        equal the number of DB-Servers and has a value of `0`. _(cluster only)_

                    for the new database. Users that do not exist yet will be created.
                    If `users` is not specified or does not contain any users, the default user
                    `root` will be used to ensure that the new database will be accessible after it
                    is created. The `root` user is created with an empty password should it not
                    exist. Each user object can contain the following attributes:

                          log into the database. The default is `true`. The attribute is ignored for users
