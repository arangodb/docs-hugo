Oasisctl is a command-line tool for using the [ArangoGraph API](../../develop/http/_index.md).
This tool makes integration of ArangoGraph in all kinds of (bash) scripts easy.
It is also a good example on how to use the API.

See [Getting started with Oasisctl](../arangograph-api/getting-started.md) for a
tutorial.

Oasisctl is available for Linux, macOS and Windows.
