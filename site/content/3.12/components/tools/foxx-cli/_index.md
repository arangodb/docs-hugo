Foxx CLI is an optional tool which requires Node.js and can be installed via the
package managers NPM and Yarn.

It is the successor of `foxx-manager`, which is deprecated and will be
removed eventually. Also see [Foxx Deployment](../../../develop/foxx-microservices/deployment.md)
for additional deployment options.

_foxx-cli_ relies on the [Foxx HTTP API](../../../develop/http-api/foxx.md).
