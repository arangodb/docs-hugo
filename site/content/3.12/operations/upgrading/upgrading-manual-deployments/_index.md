It is possible to upgrade ArangoDB setups manually without the help of any
of our deployment tools. Be aware that you need to be careful when following the steps,
otherwise you may risk downtime or losing data (depending on the specific deployment).

Available Guides:

- Manually Upgrade an [Active Failover Deployment](upgrading-an-active-failover-deployment.md)
- Manually Upgrade a [Cluster Deployment](upgrading-a-cluster.md)
