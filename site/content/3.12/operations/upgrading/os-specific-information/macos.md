## Upgrading via Package

[Download](https://www.arangodb.com/download/) the latest
ArangoDB macOS package and install it as usual by mounting the `.dmg` file.
Drag and drop the `ArangoDB3-CLI` (Community Edition) or the `ArangoDB3e-CLI`
(Enterprise Edition) file onto the shown `Applications` folder.
You are asked if you want to replace the old file with the newer one.
