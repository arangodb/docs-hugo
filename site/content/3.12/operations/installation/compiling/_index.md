ArangoDB can be compiled from [source](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb)
on Linux systems with certain versions of the GNU C/C++ compiler or clang/clang++.
See the [`VERSIONS` file](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/blob/devel/VERSIONS)
in the root directory of the repository for the officially supported versions of
the C++ standard, the compilers, and so on.

By default, cloning the GitHub repository will checkout the _devel_ branch.
This branch contains the development version of the ArangoDB. Use this branch
if you want to make changes to the ArangoDB source.
