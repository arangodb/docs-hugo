  ArangoDB v3.12 Release Notes API Changes

---
This document summarizes the HTTP API changes and other API changes in ArangoDB 3.12.
The target audience for this document are developers who maintain drivers and
integrations for ArangoDB 3.12.

## HTTP RESTful API

### Behavior changes

The following long-deprecated features have been removed from ArangoDB's HTTP
server:

- Overriding the HTTP method by setting one of the HTTP headers:
  - `x-http-method`
  - `x-http-method-override`
  - `x-method-override`

   This functionality posed a potential security risk and was thus removed.
   Previously, it was only enabled when explicitly starting the 
   server with the `--http.allow-method-override` startup option.
   The functionality has now been removed and setting the startup option does
   nothing.

- Optionally hiding ArangoDB's `server` response header. This functionality
  could optionally be enabled by starting the server with the startup option
  `--http.hide-product-header`.
  The functionality has now been removed and setting the startup option does
  nothing.

#### Collection API

When creating a collection using the `POST /_api/collection` endpoint, the
server log now displays a deprecation message if illegal combinations and
unknown attributes and values are detected in the request body.

Note that all invalid elements and combinations will be rejected in future
versions.

#### Index API

##### Stored values can contain the `_id` attribute

The usage of the `_id` system attribute was previously disallowed for
`persistent` indexes inside of `storedValues`. This is now allowed in v3.12.

Note that it is still forbidden to use `_id` as a top-level attribute or
sub-attribute in `fields` of persistent indexes. On the other hand, inverted
indexes have been allowing to index and store the `_id` system attribute.

### Privilege changes



### Endpoint return value changes

#### Storage engine API

- The storage engine API at `GET /_api/engine` does not return the attribute
  `dfdb` anymore.

- On single servers and DB-Servers, the `GET /_api/engine` endpoint now
  returns an `endianness` attribute. Currently, only Little Endian is supported
  as an architecture by ArangoDB. The value is therefore `"little"`.

### Endpoints added



### Endpoints augmented

#### View API

Views of type `arangosearch` accept a new `optimizeTopK` View property for the
ArangoSearch WAND optimization. It is an immutable array of strings, optional,
and defaults to `[]`.

See the [`optimizeTopK` View property](../../index-and-search/arangosearch/arangosearch-views-reference.md#view-properties)
for details.

#### Index API

Indexes of type `inverted` accept a new `optimizeTopK` property for the
ArangoSearch WAND optimization. It is an array of strings, optional, and
defaults to `[]`.

See the [inverted index `optimizeTopK` property](../../develop/http/indexes/inverted.md)
for details.

#### Optimizer rule descriptions

<small>Introduced in: v3.10.9, v3.11.2</small>

The `GET /_api/query/rules` endpoint now includes a `description` attribute for
every optimizer rule that briefly explains what it does.

#### Query parsing API

The `POST /_api/query` endpoint for parsing AQL queries now unconditionally
returns the `warnings` attribute, even if no warnings were produced while parsing
the query. In that case, `warnings` contains an empty array.
In previous versions, no `warnings` attribute was returned when parsing a query
produced no warnings.

### Endpoints moved



### Endpoints deprecated

### Endpoints removed

#### Database target version API

The `GET /_admin/database/target-version` endpoint has been removed in favor of the
more general version API with the endpoint `GET /_api/version`. 
The endpoint was deprecated since v3.11.3.

#### JavaScript-based traversal using `/_api/traversal`

The long-deprecated JavaScript-based traversal functionality has been removed
in v3.12.0, including the REST API endpoint `/_api/traversal`.

The functionality provided by this API was deprecated and unmaintained since
v3.4.0. JavaScript-based traversals have been replaced with AQL traversals in
v2.8.0. Additionally, the JavaScript-based traversal REST API could not handle
larger amounts of data and was thus very limited.

Users of the `/_api/traversal` REST API should use
[AQL traversal queries](../../aql/graphs/traversals.md) instead.

## JavaScript API

### Collection creation

When creating a collection using the `db._create()`, `db._createDocumentCollection()`, or
`db._createEdgeCollection()` method, the server log now displays a deprecation message if illegal
combinations and unknown properties are detected in the `properties` object.

Note that all invalid elements and combinations will be rejected in future
versions.

### `@arangodb/graph/traversal` module

The long-deprecated JavaScript-based traversal functionality has been removed in
v3.12.0, including the bundled `@arangodb/graph/traversal` JavaScript module.

The functionality provided by this traversal module was deprecated and
unmaintained since v3.4.0. JavaScript-based traversals have been replaced with
AQL traversals in v2.8.0. Additionally, the JavaScript-based traversals could
not handle larger amounts of data and were thus very limited.

Users of the JavaScript-based traversal API should use
[AQL traversal queries](../../aql/graphs/traversals.md) instead.
