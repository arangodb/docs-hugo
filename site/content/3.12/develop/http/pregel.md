## Start a Pregel job execution

paths:
  /_api/control_pregel:
    post:
      operationId: createPregelJob
      description: |
        To start an execution you need to specify the algorithm name and a named graph
        (SmartGraph in cluster). Alternatively you can specify the vertex and edge
        collections. Additionally you can specify custom parameters which vary for each
        algorithm, see [Pregel - Available Algorithms](../../data-science/pregel/pregel-algorithms.md).

                    General as well as algorithm-specific options.

                    The most important general option is "store", which controls whether the results
                    computed by the Pregel job are written back into the source collections or not.

                    Another important general option is "parallelism", which controls the number of
                    parallel threads that work on the Pregel job at most. If "parallelism" is not
                    specified, a default value may be used. In addition, the value of "parallelism"
                    may be effectively capped at some server-specific value.

                    The option "useMemoryMaps" controls whether to use disk based files to store
                    temporary results. This might make the computation disk-bound, but allows you to
                    run computations which would not fit into main memory. It is recommended to set
                    this flag for larger datasets.

                    The attribute "shardKeyAttribute" specifies the shard key that edge collections are
                    sharded after (default: `"vertex"`).

                      - `"none"`: The Pregel run did not yet start.
                      - `"loading"`: The graph is loaded from the database into memory before the execution of the algorithm.
                      - `"running"`: The algorithm is executing normally.
                      - `"storing"`: The algorithm finished, but the results are still being written
                        back into the collections. Occurs only if the store parameter is set to true.
                      - `"done"`: The execution is done. In version 3.7.1 and later, this means that
                        storing is also done. In earlier versions, the results may not be written back
                        into the collections yet. This event is announced in the server log (requires
                        at least info log level for the `pregel` log topic).
                      - `"canceled"`: The execution was permanently canceled, either by the user or by
                        an error.
                      - `"fatal error"`: The execution has failed and cannot recover.
                      - `"in error"`: The execution is in an error state. This can be
                        caused by DB-Servers being not reachable or being non responsive. The execution
                        might recover later, or switch to `"canceled"` if it was not able to recover
                        successfully.
                      - `"recovering"` (currently unused): The execution is actively recovering and
                        switches back to `running` if the recovery is successful.

                        - `"loading"`: The graph is loaded from the database into memory before the execution of the algorithm.
                        - `"running"`: The algorithm is executing normally.
                        - `"storing"`: The algorithm finished, but the results are still being written
                          back into the collections. Occurs only if the store parameter is set to true.
                        - `"done"`: The execution is done. In version 3.7.1 and later, this means that
                          storing is also done. In earlier versions, the results may not be written back
                          into the collections yet. This event is announced in the server log (requires

                          an error.

                        - `"in error"`: The execution is in an error state. This can be
                          caused by DB-Servers being not reachable or being non responsive. The execution
                          might recover later, or switch to `"canceled"` if it was not able to recover
                          successfully.
                        - `"recovering"` (currently unused): The execution is actively recovering and
                          switches back to `running` if the recovery is successful.

                      - `"loading"`: The graph is loaded from the database into memory before the execution of the algorithm.
                      - `"running"`: The algorithm is executing normally.
                      - `"storing"`: The algorithm finished, but the results are still being written
                        back into the collections. Occurs only if the store parameter is set to true.
                      - `"done"`: The execution is done. In version 3.7.1 and later, this means that
                        storing is also done. In earlier versions, the results may not be written back
                        into the collections yet. This event is announced in the server log (requires

                        an error.
                      - `"fatal error"`: The execution has failed and cannot recover.
                      - `"in error"`: The execution is in an error state. This can be
                        caused by DB-Servers being not reachable or being non responsive. The execution
                        might recover later, or switch to `"canceled"` if it was not able to recover
                        successfully.
                      - `"recovering"` (currently unused): The execution is actively recovering and

                        The state of the execution. The following values can be returned:
                        - `"none"`: The Pregel run did not yet start.
                        - `"loading"`: The graph is loaded from the database into memory before the execution of the algorithm.
                        - `"running"`: The algorithm is executing normally.
                        - `"storing"`: The algorithm finished, but the results are still being written
                          back into the collections. Occurs only if the store parameter is set to true.
                        - `"done"`: The execution is done. In version 3.7.1 and later, this means that
                          storing is also done. In earlier versions, the results may not be written back
                          into the collections yet. This event is announced in the server log (requires
                          at least info log level for the `pregel` log topic).
                        - `"canceled"`: The execution was permanently canceled, either by the user or by
                          an error.
                        - `"fatal error"`: The execution has failed and cannot recover.
                        - `"in error"`: The execution is in an error state. This can be
                          caused by DB-Servers being not reachable or being non responsive. The execution
                          might recover later, or switch to `"canceled"` if it was not able to recover
                          successfully.
                        - `"recovering"` (currently unused): The execution is actively recovering and
                          switches back to `running` if the recovery is successful.
