  Server statistics let you monitor the system but they are superseded by

## Get the statistics

```openapi
paths:
  /_admin/statistics:
    get:
      operationId: getStatistics
      description: |
        {{</* warning */>}}
        This endpoint should no longer be used. It is deprecated from version 3.8.0 on.
        Use `/_admin/metrics/v2` instead, which provides the data exposed by this API
        and a lot more.
        {{</* /warning */>}}

        Returns the statistics information. The returned object contains the
        statistics figures grouped together according to the description returned by
        `/_admin/statistics-description`. For instance, to access a figure `userTime`
        from the group `system`, you first select the sub-object describing the
        group stored in `system` and in that sub-object the value for `userTime` is
        stored in the attribute of the same name.

        In case of a distribution, the returned object contains the total count in
        `count` and the distribution list in `counts`. The sum (or total) of the
        individual values is returned in `sum`.

        The transaction statistics show the local started, committed and aborted
        transactions as well as intermediate commits done for the server queried. The
        intermediate commit count will only take non zero values for the RocksDB
        storage engine. Coordinators do almost no local transactions themselves in
        their local databases, therefor cluster transactions (transactions started on a
        Coordinator that require DB-Servers to finish before the transactions is
        committed cluster wide) are just added to their local statistics. This means
        that the statistics you would see for a single server is roughly what you can
        expect in a cluster setup using a single Coordinator querying this Coordinator.
        Just with the difference that cluster transactions have no notion of
        intermediate commits and will not increase the value.

        This endpoint should no longer be used. It is deprecated from version 3.8.0 on.
        Use `/_admin/metrics/v2` instead, which provides the data exposed by the
        statistics API and a lot more.
        {{</* /warning */>}}

        Returns a description of the statistics returned by `/_admin/statistics`.
        The returned objects contains an array of statistics groups in the attribute
        `groups` and an array of statistics figures in the attribute `figures`.

        A statistics group is described by

        - `group`: The identifier of the group.
        - `name`: The name of the group.
        - `description`: A description of the group.

        A statistics figure is described by

        - `group`: The identifier of the group to which this figure belongs.
        - `identifier`: The identifier of the figure. It is unique within the group.
        - `name`: The name of the figure.
        - `description`: A description of the figure.
        - `type`: Either `current`, `accumulated`, or `distribution`.
        - `cuts`: The distribution vector.
        - `units`: Units in which the figure is measured.
