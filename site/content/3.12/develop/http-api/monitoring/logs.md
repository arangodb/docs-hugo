  Server events and errors are logged depending on the defined log levels for
  the available log topics
archetype: default
---
Whether events are logged to a file, syslog, or only an attached terminal depends
on the [log startup options](../../../components/arangodb-server/options.md#log).

See [Log levels](../../../operations/administration/log-levels.md) for a detailed
description of the `FATAL`, `ERROR`, and other levels of log messages.

## Get the global server logs

```openapi
paths:
  /_admin/log/entries:
    get:
      operationId: getLogEntries
      description: |
        Returns fatal, error, warning or info log messages from the server's global log.
        The result is a JSON object with the following properties:

        - **total**: the total amount of log entries before pagination
        - **messages**: an array with log messages that matched the criteria

        This API can be turned off via the startup option `--log.api-enabled`. In case
        the API is disabled, all requests will be responded to with HTTP 403. If the
        API is enabled, accessing it requires admin privileges, or even superuser
        privileges, depending on the value of the `--log.api-enabled` startup option.
      parameters:
        - name: upto
          in: query

            Sort the log entries either ascending (if `sort` is `asc`) or descending
            (if `sort` is `desc`) according to their `id` values. Note that the `id`
            imposes a chronological order. The default value is `asc`.

## Get the global server logs (deprecated)

```openapi
paths:
  /_admin/log:
    get:
      operationId: getLog
      description: |
        {{</* warning */>}}
        This endpoint should no longer be used. It is deprecated from version 3.8.0 on.
        Use `/_admin/log/entries` instead, which provides the same data in a more
        intuitive and easier to process format.
        {{</* /warning */>}}

        Returns fatal, error, warning or info log messages from the server's global log.
        The result is a JSON object with the attributes described below.

        This API can be turned off via the startup option `--log.api-enabled`. In case
        the API is disabled, all requests will be responded to with HTTP 403. If the

## Get the server log levels

```openapi
paths:
  /_admin/log/level:
    get:
      operationId: getLogLevel
      description: |
        Returns the server's current log level settings.
        The result is a JSON object with the log topics being the object keys, and
        the log levels being the object values.

        This API can be turned off via the startup option `--log.api-enabled`. In case
        the API is disabled, all requests will be responded to with HTTP 403. If the

## Set the server log levels

```openapi
paths:
  /_admin/log/level:
    put:
      operationId: setLogLevel
      description: |
        Modifies and returns the server's current log level settings.
        The request body must be a JSON string with a log level or a JSON object with the
        log topics being the object keys and the log levels being the object values.

        If only a JSON string is specified as input, the log level is adjusted for the
        "general" log topic only. If a JSON object is specified as input, the log levels will
        be set only for the log topic mentioned in the input object, but preserved for every
        other log topic.
        To set the log level for all log levels to a specific value, it is possible to hand
        in the special pseudo log topic "all".

        The result is a JSON object with all available log topics being the object keys, and
        the adjusted log levels being the object values.

        Possible log levels are:
        - FATAL - There will be no way out of this. ArangoDB will go down after this message.
        - ERROR - This is an error. you should investigate and fix it. It may harm your production.
        - WARNING - This may be serious application-wise, but we don't know.
        - INFO - Something has happened, take notice, but no drama attached.
        - DEBUG - output debug messages
        - TRACE - trace - prepare your log to be flooded - don't use in production.

        This API can be turned off via the startup option `--log.api-enabled`. In case
        the API is disabled, all requests will be responded to with HTTP 403. If the
        API is enabled, accessing it requires admin privileges, or even superuser
        privileges, depending on the value of the `--log.api-enabled` startup option.

## Get the structured log settings

```openapi
paths:
  /_admin/log/structured:
    get:
      operationId: getStructuredLog
      description: |
        Returns the server's current structured log settings.
        The result is a JSON object with the log parameters being the object keys, and
        `true` or `false` being the object values, meaning the parameters are either
        enabled or disabled.

        This API can be turned off via the startup option `--log.api-enabled`. In case
        the API is disabled, all requests will be responded to with HTTP 403. If the
        API is enabled, accessing it requires admin privileges, or even superuser
        privileges, depending on the value of the `--log.api-enabled` startup option.
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |
            is returned if the request is valid
        '403':
          description: |
            is returned if there are insufficient privileges to read structured log
            parameters.
        '405':
          description: |
            is returned when an invalid HTTP method is used.

## Set the structured log settings

```openapi
paths:
  /_admin/log/structured:
    put:
      operationId: setStructuredLog
      description: |
        Modifies and returns the server's current structured log settings.
        The request body must be a JSON object with the structured log parameters
        being the object keys and `true` or `false` object values, for either
        enabling or disabling the parameters.

        The result is a JSON object with all available structured log parameters being
        the object keys, and `true` or `false` being the object values, meaning the
        parameter in the object key is either enabled or disabled.

        This API can be turned off via the startup option `--log.api-enabled`. In case
        the API is disabled, all requests will be responded to with HTTP 403. If the
        API is enabled, accessing it requires admin privileges, or even superuser
        privileges, depending on the value of the `--log.api-enabled` startup option.
