  Server events and errors are logged depending on the defined log levels for
  the available log topics
---
Whether events are logged to a file, syslog, or only an attached terminal depends
on the [log startup options](../../../components/arangodb-server/options.md#log).

See [Log levels](../../../operations/administration/log-levels.md) for a detailed
description of the `FATAL`, `ERROR`, and other levels of log messages.

The permissions required to use the `/_admin/log*` endpoints depends on the
setting of the [`--log.api-enabled` startup option](../../../components/arangodb-server/options.md#--logapi-enabled).

## Get the global server logs

```openapi
paths:
  /_admin/log/entries:
    get:
      operationId: getLogEntries
      description: |
        Returns fatal, error, warning or info log messages from the server's global log.
        The result is a JSON object with the following properties:

        - **total**: the total amount of log entries before pagination
        - **messages**: an array with log messages that matched the criteria

        This API can be turned off via the startup option `--log.api-enabled`. In case
        the API is disabled, all requests will be responded to with HTTP 403. If the
        API is enabled, accessing it requires admin privileges, or even superuser
        privileges, depending on the value of the `--log.api-enabled` startup option.
      parameters:
        - name: upto
          in: query
          required: false
          description: |

## Get the global server logs (deprecated)

```openapi
paths:
  /_admin/log:
    get:
      operationId: getLog
      description: |
        {{</* warning */>}}
        This endpoint should no longer be used. It is deprecated from version 3.8.0 on.
        Use `/_admin/log/entries` instead, which provides the same data in a more
        intuitive and easier to process format.
        {{</* /warning */>}}

        Returns fatal, error, warning or info log messages from the server's global log.
        The result is a JSON object with the attributes described below.

        This API can be turned off via the startup option `--log.api-enabled`. In case
        the API is disabled, all requests will be responded to with HTTP 403. If the

## Get the server log levels

```openapi
paths:
  /_admin/log/level:
    get:

      description: |
        Returns the server's current log level settings.
        The result is a JSON object with the log topics being the object keys, and

## Set the server log levels

```openapi
paths:
  /_admin/log/level:
    put:
      operationId: setLogLevel
      description: |
        Modifies and returns the server's current log level settings.
        The request body must be a JSON string with a log level or a JSON object with the
        log topics being the object keys and the log levels being the object values.

        If only a JSON string is specified as input, the log level is adjusted for the
        "general" log topic only. If a JSON object is specified as input, the log levels will
        be set only for the log topic mentioned in the input object, but preserved for every
        other log topic.
        To set the log level for all log levels to a specific value, it is possible to hand
        in the special pseudo log topic "all".

        The result is a JSON object with all available log topics being the object keys, and
        the adjusted log levels being the object values.

        Possible log levels are:
        - `FATAL` - Only critical errors are logged after which the _arangod_
          process terminates.
        - `ERROR` - Only errors are logged. You should investigate and fix errors
          as they may harm your production.
        - `WARNING` - Errors and warnings are logged. Warnings may be serious
          application-wise and can indicate issues that might lead to errors
          later on.
        - `INFO` - Errors, warnings, and general information is logged.
        - `DEBUG` - Outputs debug messages used in the development of ArangoDB
          in addition to the above.
        - `TRACE` - Logs detailed tracing of operations in addition to the above.
          This can flood the log. Don't use this log level in production.

        This API can be turned off via the startup option `--log.api-enabled`. In case
        the API is disabled, all requests will be responded to with HTTP 403. If the
        API is enabled, accessing it requires admin privileges, or even superuser
        privileges, depending on the value of the `--log.api-enabled` startup option.

            Set this option to `true` to set individual log level settings
            for log outputs (`appenders`). The request and response structure is
            as follows:

            ```json
            {
              "global": {
                "agency": "INFO",
                "agencycomm": "INFO",
                "agencystore": "WARNING",
                ...
              },
              "appenders": {
                "-": {
                  "agency": "INFO",
                  "agencycomm": "INFO",
                  "agencystore": "WARNING",
                  ...
                },
                "file:///path/to/file": {
                  "agency": "INFO",
                  "agencycomm": "INFO",
                  "agencystore": "WARNING",
                  ...
                },
                ...
              }
            }
            ```

            Changing the `global` settings affects all outputs and is the same
            as setting a log level with this option turned off.

## Reset the server log levels

<small>Introduced in: v3.12.1</small>

```openapi
paths:
  /_admin/log/level:
    delete:
      operationId: resetLogLevel
      description: |
        Revert the server's log level settings to the values they had at startup,
        as determined by the startup options specified on the command-line, a
        configuration file, and the factory defaults.

        The result is a JSON object with the log topics being the object keys, and
        the log levels being the object values.

        This API can be turned off via the startup option `--log.api-enabled`. In case
        the API is disabled, all requests will be responded to with HTTP 403. If the
        API is enabled, accessing it requires admin privileges, or even superuser
        privileges, depending on the value of the `--log.api-enabled` startup option.
      parameters:
        - name: serverId
          in: query
          required: false

## Get the structured log settings

```openapi
paths:
  /_admin/log/structured:
    get:
      operationId: getStructuredLog
      description: |
        Returns the server's current structured log settings.
        The result is a JSON object with the log parameters being the object keys, and
        `true` or `false` being the object values, meaning the parameters are either
        enabled or disabled.

        This API can be turned off via the startup option `--log.api-enabled`. In case
        the API is disabled, all requests will be responded to with HTTP 403. If the
        API is enabled, accessing it requires admin privileges, or even superuser
        privileges, depending on the value of the `--log.api-enabled` startup option.
      responses:
        '200':
          description: |
            is returned if the request is valid
        '403':
          description: |

  /_admin/log/structured:
    put:
      operationId: setStructuredLog
      description: |
        Modifies and returns the server's current structured log settings.
        The request body must be a JSON object with the structured log parameters
        being the object keys and `true` or `false` object values, for either
        enabling or disabling the parameters.

        The result is a JSON object with all available structured log parameters being
        the object keys, and `true` or `false` being the object values, meaning the
        parameter in the object key is either enabled or disabled.

        This API can be turned off via the startup option `--log.api-enabled`. In case
        the API is disabled, all requests will be responded to with HTTP 403. If the
        API is enabled, accessing it requires admin privileges, or even superuser
        privileges, depending on the value of the `--log.api-enabled` startup option.
