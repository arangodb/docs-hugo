                    Index names are subject to the same character restrictions as collection names.
                    If omitted, a name is auto-generated so that it is unique with respect to the
                    collection, e.g. `idx_832910498`.

                    attribute after which the documents count as expired. Can be set to `0` to let
                    documents expire as soon as the server time passes the point in time stored in
                    the document attribute, or to a higher number to delay the expiration.
