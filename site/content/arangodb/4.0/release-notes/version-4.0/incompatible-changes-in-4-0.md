  Check the following list of potential breaking changes **before** upgrading to
  this ArangoDB version and adjust any client applications if necessary
---
## Emergency console mode removed

The ArangoDB server process could be started in an interactive command-line
mode (JavaScript REPL) with the `--console` option. This was primarily used
for debugging purposes in the development of _arangod_.
This option and feature have been removed.

## HTTP RESTful API

### Batch request endpoint removed

<small>Removed in: v3.12.3</small>

The `/_api/batch` endpoints that let you send multiple operations in a single
HTTP request was deprecated in v3.8.0 and has now been removed.

To send multiple documents at once to an ArangoDB instance, please use the
[HTTP interface for documents](../../develop/http-api/documents.md#multiple-document-operations)
that can insert, update, replace, or remove arrays of documents.

## JavaScript API



## Startup options

### `--console` obsolete

The `--console` startup option no longer has an effect but it is still
recognized to avoid causing a fatal error on startup if you specify it.

## Client tools

### arangobench

#### Batch size option removed

<small>Removed in: v3.12.3</small>

The `--batch-size` startup option is now ignored by arangobench and no longer
has an effect. It allowed you to specify the number of operations to issue in
one batch but the batch request API has been removed on the server-side.
