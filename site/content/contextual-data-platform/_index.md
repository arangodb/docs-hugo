weight: 1
description: >-
  The Arango Data Platform provides entity-aware retrieval, graph-based reasoning,
  temporal state management, and platform-level governance to support reliable,
  stateful agentic AI systems in production environments
---
The Contextual Data Platform builds on the Arango Data Platform, combining the
[Platform Suite](../data-platform/_index.md) with the [Agentic AI Suite](../agentic-ai-suite/_index.md).

What you get on top of the Data Platform with the Agentic AI Suite:

- [GraphRAG](../agentic-ai-suite/graphrag/_index.md): Generate knowledge graphs from documents and enable
   conversational querying of your data.
- [GraphML](../agentic-ai-suite/graphml/_index.md): Apply machine learning algorithms that leverage graph
  structure for better predictions.
- [AQLizer](../agentic-ai-suite/aqlizer.md): Generate AQL queries from natural language.
- [Jupyter notebooks](../agentic-ai-suite/notebook-servers.md): Run Jupyter Notebooks to build and
  experiment with graph-powered data, AI, and machine learning workflows directly connected
  to ArangoDB databases. 
- Public and private LLM support: Use public LLMs such as OpenAI
  or private LLMs with [Triton Inference Server](../agentic-ai-suite/reference/triton-inference-server.md).
- [MLflow integration](../agentic-ai-suite/reference/mlflow.md): Use the popular MLflow as a model registry
  for private LLMs or to run machine learning experiments as part of the Arango Data Platform.
